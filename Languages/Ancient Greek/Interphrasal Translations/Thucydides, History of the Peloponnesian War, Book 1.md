Θουκυδίδης Ἀθηναῖος [Thucydides, an Athenian] ξυνέγραψε [wrote] τὸν πόλεμον [the war] τῶν Πελοποννησίων καὶ Ἀθηναίων [of the Peloponnesians and Athenians], ὡς [how] ἐπολέμησαν [they warred] πρὸς ἀλλήλους [against each other]. ἀρξάμενος [Beginning] εὐθὺς καθισταμένου [immediately when it was breaking out] καὶ ἐλπίσας [and expecting] μέγαν τε ἔσεσθαι [that it would be great] καὶ ἀξιολογώτατον [and most noteworthy] τῶν προγεγενημένων [of those that had happened before]. τεκμαιρόμενος [concluding] ὅτι ἀκμάζοντές τε ᾖσαν [that they were both at their peak] ἐς αὐτὸν ἀμφότεροι [with respect to it] παρασκευῇ τῇ πάσῃ [in every preparation] καὶ τὸ ἄλλο Ἑλληνικὸν ὁρῶν [and seeing the rest of the Greeks] ξυνιστάμενον [uniting] πρὸς ἑκατέρους [with each of the two sides]. τὸ μὲν εὐθύς [some immediately], τὸ δὲ καὶ διανοούμενον [and others intending to do so].

κίνησις γὰρ αὕτη [For this movement] μεγίστη δὴ [greatest by far] τοῖς Ἕλλησιν ἐγένετο [happened to the Greeks] καὶ μέρει τινὶ τῶν βαρβάρων [and to a part of the barbarians], ὡς δὲ εἰπεῖν [so to speak] καὶ ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἀνθρώπων [and to most of mankind].

τὰ γὰρ πρὸ αὐτῶν [For the things before them] καὶ τὰ ἔτι παλαίτερα [and the still earlier things] σαφῶς μὲν εὑρεῖν [to find out clearly] διὰ χρόνου πλῆθος [because of the length of time] ἀδύνατα ἦν [was impossible], ἐκ δὲ τεκμηρίων [but from evidence] ὧν [which] ἐπὶ μακρότατον σκοποῦντί μοι [examining as far back as possible] πιστεῦσαι ξυμβαίνει [I happen to trust] οὐ μεγάλα νομίζω γενέσθαι [I think were not great] οὔτε κατὰ τοὺς πολέμους [neither in the wars] οὔτε ἐς τὰ ἄλλα [nor in other things].

φαίνεται γὰρ ἡ νῦν Ἑλλὰς καλουμένη [For what is now called Greece] οὐ πάλαι βεβαίως οἰκουμένη [was not settled securely long ago], ἀλλὰ μεταναστάσεις τε οὖσαι τὰ πρότερα [but migrations occurred formerly] καὶ ῥᾳδίως ἕκαστοι τὴν ἑαυτῶν ἀπολείποντες [and they each easily left their own land] βιαζόμενοι ὑπό τινων αἰεὶ πλειόνων [being compelled by ever greater numbers].

τῆς γὰρ ἐμπορίας οὐκ οὔσης [For since trade did not exist] οὐδ’ ἐπιμειγνύντες ἀδεῶς ἀλλήλοις [nor did they mix fearlessly with one another] οὔτε κατὰ γῆν [neither by land] οὔτε διὰ θαλάσσης [nor by sea]. νεμόμενοί τε τὰ αὑτῶν ἕκαστοι [and each cultivating their own land] ὅσον ἀποζῆν [enough to live off] καὶ περιουσίαν χρημάτων οὐκ ἔχοντες [and not possessing surplus wealth] οὐδὲ γῆν φυτεύοντες [nor planting the land], ἄδηλον ὂν [it being uncertain] ὁπότε τις ἐπελθὼν [when someone might attack] καὶ ἀτειχίστων ἅμα ὄντων [and since they were also unwalled] ἄλλος ἀφαιρήσεται [another would take it away]. τῆς τε καθ’ ἡμέραν ἀναγκαίου τροφῆς [and of their daily necessary food] πανταχοῦ ἂν ἡγούμενοι ἐπικρατεῖν [believing to prevail everywhere], οὐ χαλεπῶς ἀπανίσταντο [they did not move away with difficulty], καὶ δι’ αὐτὸ [and because of this] οὔτε μεγέθει πόλεων ἴσχυον [they were neither strong in the size of cities] οὔτε τῇ ἄλλῃ παρασκευῇ [nor in other preparation].

μάλιστα δὲ τῆς γῆς ἡ ἀρίστη [And especially the best land] αἰεὶ τὰς μεταβολὰς τῶν οἰκητόρων εἶχεν [always had the changes of inhabitants]. ἥ τε νῦν Θεσσαλία καλουμένη [both what is now called Thessaly] καὶ Βοιωτία [and Boeotia] Πελοποννήσου τε τὰ πολλὰ [and most of the Peloponnese] πλὴν Ἀρκαδίας [except Arcadia], τῆς τε ἄλλης [and of the rest] ὅσα ἦν κράτιστα [as many as were the best].

διὰ γὰρ ἀρετὴν γῆς [For on account of the goodness of the land] αἵ τε δυνάμεις τισὶ μείζους ἐγγιγνόμεναι [the powers becoming greater for some] στάσεις ἐνεποίουν [caused factions] ἐξ ὧν ἐφθείροντο [by which they were destroyed]. καὶ ἅμα ὑπὸ ἀλλοφύλων μᾶλλον ἐπεβουλεύοντο [and at the same time they were more plotted against by foreigners].

τὴν γοῦν Ἀττικὴν [Attica at any rate] ἐκ τοῦ ἐπὶ πλεῖστον [for the most part] διὰ τὸ λεπτόγεων [because of its poor soil] ἀστασίαστον οὖσαν [being free of faction] ἄνθρωποι ᾤκουν οἱ αὐτοὶ αἰεί [the same men always inhabited].

καὶ παράδειγμα τόδε τοῦ λόγου οὐκ ἐλάχιστόν ἐστι [And this is not the least example for this statement] διὰ τὰς μετοικίας [because of the migrations] ἐς τὰ ἄλλα μὴ ὁμοίως αὐξηθῆναι [that other places did not increase similarly]. ἐκ γὰρ τῆς ἄλλης Ἑλλάδος [For from the rest of Greece] οἱ πολέμῳ ἢ στάσει ἐκπίπτοντες [those being driven out by war or faction] παρ Ἀθηναίους [to the Athenians] οἱ δυνατώτατοι [the most powerful ones] ὡς βέβαιον ὂν ἀνεχώρουν [withdrew as to a secure place] καὶ πολῖται γιγνόμενοι [and becoming citizens] εὐθὺς ἀπὸ παλαιοῦ [immediately from of old] μείζω ἔτι ἐποίησαν [made even greater] πλήθει ἀνθρώπων τὴν πόλιν [the city in number of men]. ὥστε καὶ ἐς Ἰωνίαν ὕστερον [so that also into Ionia later] ὡς οὐχ ἱκανῆς οὔσης τῆς Ἀττικῆς [since Attica was not sufficient] ἀποικίας ἐξέπεμψαν [they sent out colonies].

δηλοῖ δέ μοι καὶ τόδε τῶν παλαιῶν ἀσθένειαν οὐχ ἥκιστα [This also shows me especially the weakness of the ancients]. πρὸ γὰρ τῶν Τρωικῶν [For before the Trojan War] οὐδὲν φαίνεται πρότερον κοινῇ ἐργασαμένη ἡ Ἑλλάς [Greece seems to have done nothing in common previously].

δοκεῖ δέ μοι, οὐδὲ τοὔνομα τοῦτο ξύμπασά πω εἶχεν [And it seems to me that it did not yet have this name altogether]. ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν πρὸ Ἕλληνος τοῦ Δευκαλίωνος [But before Hellen, son of Deucalion] καὶ πάνυ οὐδὲ εἶναι ἡ ἐπίκλησις αὕτη [this name not even to be at all] κατὰ ἔθνη δὲ [but according to tribes] ἄλλα τε καὶ τὸ Πελασγικὸν [both others and the Pelasgian] ἐπὶ πλεῖστον [for the most part] ἀφ’ ἑαυτῶν τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν παρέχεσθαι [gave the appellation from themselves]. Ἕλληνος δὲ καὶ τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ Φθιώτιδι ἰσχυσάντων [But Hellen and his sons, when they had become powerful in Phthiotis] καὶ ἐπαγομένων αὐτοὺς ἐπ’ ὠφελίᾳ ἐς τὰς ἄλλας πόλεις [and were inviting them for their benefit to the other cities], καθ’ ἑκάστους μὲν ἤδη [according to each already] τῇ ὁμιλίᾳ μᾶλλον καλεῖσθαι Ἕλληνας [to be called Hellenes more from their association] οὐ μέντοι πολλοῦ γε χρόνου [not, however, a long time] καὶ ἅπασιν ἐκνικῆσαι [and to prevail among all].

τεκμηριοῖ δὲ μάλιστα Ὅμηρος [Homer especially bears witness to this]. πολλῷ γὰρ ὕστερον ἔτι καὶ τῶν Τρωικῶν γενόμενος [For having been born much later even than the Trojan War] οὐδαμοῦ τοὺς ξύμπαντας ὠνόμασεν [he called them altogether nowhere] οὐδ’ ἄλλους ἢ [nor others than] τοὺς μετ’ Ἀχιλλέως ἐκ τῆς Φθιώτιδος [those with Achilles from Phthiotis] οἵπερ καὶ πρῶτοι Ἕλληνες ἦσαν [who indeed were the first Hellenes]. Δαναοὺς δὲ ἐν τοῖς ἔπεσι καὶ Ἀργείους καὶ Ἀχαιοὺς ἀνακαλεῖ [But in his poems he calls them Danaans and Argives and Achaeans]. οὐ μὴν οὐδὲ βαρβάρους εἴρηκε [He did not however call them barbarians] διὰ τὸ μηδὲ Ἕλληνάς πω [because neither were the Hellenes yet] ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ [as it seems to me] ἀντίπαλον ἐς ἓν ὄνομα ἀποκεκρίσθαι [distinguished in contrast to a single name].

οἱ δ’ οὖν ὡς ἕκαστοι Ἕλληνες [Those therefore who, each for themselves, were Hellenes] κατὰ πόλεις τε ὅσοι ἀλλήλων ξυνίεσαν [according to cities, as many as understood each other] καὶ ξύμπαντες ὕστερον κληθέντες [and, as a whole, those called later] οὐδὲν πρὸ τῶν Τρωικῶν [nothing before the Trojan War] δι’ ἀσθένειαν καὶ ἀμειξίαν ἀλλήλων [because of weakness and lack of interaction with each other] ἁθρόοι ἔπραξαν [did in common]. ἀλλὰ καὶ ταύτην τὴν στρατείαν [But this expedition too] θαλάσσῃ ἤδη πλείω χρώμενοι ξυνεξῆλθον [they undertook already making more use of the sea].

Μίνως γὰρ παλαίτατος ὧν ἀκοῇ ἴσμεν [For Minos, the earliest of whom we know by report] ναυτικὸν ἐκτήσατο [acquired a navy] καὶ τῆς νῦν Ἑλληνικῆς θαλάσσης [and of what is now the Greek sea] ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἐκράτησε [held control for the most part] καὶ τῶν Κυκλάδων νήσων ἦρξέ τε καὶ οἰκιστὴς πρῶτος τῶν πλείστων ἐγένετο [and ruled the Cycladic islands and became the first settler of most of them]. Κᾶρας ἐξελάσας [Having driven out the Carians] καὶ τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ παῖδας ἡγεμόνας ἐγκαταστήσας [and having established his own sons as leaders]. τό τε λῃστικόν [and piracy], ὡς εἰκός [as is likely], καθῄρει ἐκ τῆς θαλάσσης [he swept from the sea] ἐφ’ ὅσον ἐδύνατο [as much as he could] τοῦ τὰς προσόδους μᾶλλον ἰέναι αὐτῷ [so that the revenues would better come to him].

οἱ γὰρ Ἕλληνες τὸ πάλαι [For the Greeks of old] καὶ τῶν βαρβάρων [and of the barbarians] οἵ τε ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ παραθαλάσσιοι [both those on the mainland dwelling by the sea] καὶ ὅσοι νήσους εἶχον [and as many as possessed islands], ἐπειδὴ ἤρξαντο μᾶλλον περαιοῦσθαι ναυσὶν ἐπ’ ἀλλήλους [when they began to cross over against one another more by ships], ἐτράποντο πρὸς λῃστείαν [turned to piracy]. ἡγουμένων ἀνδρῶν οὐ τῶν ἀδυνατωτάτων [men not the least powerful leading them] κέρδους τοῦ σφετέρου αὐτῶν ἕνεκα [for the sake of their own gain] καὶ τοῖς ἀσθενέσι τροφῆς [and food for the weak]. καὶ προσπίπτοντες πόλεσιν ἀτειχίστοις [and falling upon unwalled cities] καὶ κατὰ κώμας οἰκουμέναις [and those dwelling in villages] ἥρπαζον [they plundered] καὶ τὸν πλεῖστον τοῦ βίου ἐντεῦθεν ἐποιοῦντο [and derived most of their living from this]. οὐκ ἔχοντός πω αἰσχύνην τούτου τοῦ ἔργου [this deed not yet having shame], φέροντος δέ τι καὶ δόξης μᾶλλον [but even bringing a certain degree of glory rather].

δηλοῦσι δὲ [And they indicate this] τῶν τε ἠπειρωτῶν τινὲς ἔτι καὶ νῦν [some of the mainlanders even now still] οἷς κόσμος καλῶς τοῦτο δρᾶν [for whom it is an ornament to do this well]. καὶ οἱ παλαιοὶ τῶν ποιητῶν [and the poets of old] τὰς πύστεις τῶν καταπλεόντων πανταχοῦ ὁμοίως ἐρωτῶντες [asking the questions of those sailing in everywhere alike] εἰ λῃσταί εἰσιν [whether they are pirates]. ὡς οὔτε ὧν πυνθάνονται ἀπαξιούντων τὸ ἔργον [as neither those whom they asked disdained the work], οἷς τε ἐπιμελὲς εἴη εἰδέναι οὐκ ὀνειδιζόντων [nor those who might care to know reproaching it].

ἐλῄζοντο δὲ καὶ κατ’ ἤπειρον ἀλλήλους [They also plundered one another by land]. καὶ μέχρι τοῦδε [And up to this day] πολλὰ τῆς Ἑλλάδος τῷ παλαιῷ τρόπῳ νέμεται [much of Greece is occupied in the old way] περί τε Λοκροὺς τοὺς Ὀζόλας [around both the Ozolian Locrians] καὶ Αἰτωλοὺς καὶ Ἀκαρνᾶνας [and Aetolians and Acarnanians] καὶ τὴν ταύτῃ ἤπειρον [and the mainland in that region]. τό τε σιδηροφορεῖσθαι [And the carrying of weapons] τούτοις τοῖς ἠπειρώταις ἀπὸ τῆς παλαιᾶς λῃστείας ἐμμεμένηκεν [has remained with these mainlanders from old piracy].

πᾶσα γὰρ ἡ Ἑλλὰς ἐσιδηροφόρει [For all of Greece carried iron] διὰ τὰς ἀφάρκτους τε οἰκήσεις [because of the unfortified dwellings] καὶ οὐκ ἀσφαλεῖς παρ ἀλλήλους ἐφόδους [and the unsafe raids on one another]. καὶ ξυνήθη τὴν δίαιταν μεθ’ ὅπλων ἐποιήσαντο [and they made customary the practice of living with weapons] ὥσπερ οἱ βάρβαροι [just like the barbarians].

σημεῖον δ’ ἐστὶ ταῦτα τῆς Ἑλλάδος ἔτι οὕτω νεμόμενα [And this is a sign of Greece still being occupied in this way] τῶν ποτὲ καὶ ἐς πάντας ὁμοίων διαιτημάτων [of the way of life once the same also for everyone].

ἐν τοῖς πρῶτοι δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι [And among the first, the Athenians] τόν τε σίδηρον κατέθεντο [laid down their weapons] καὶ ἀνειμένῃ τῇ διαίτῃ [and having relaxed their way of life] ἐς τὸ τρυφερώτερον μετέστησαν [changed to a more luxurious one]. καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι αὐτοῖς τῶν εὐδαιμόνων [And the older among their wealthy] διὰ τὸ ἁβροδίαιτον [because of their refined way of life] οὐ πολὺς χρόνος ἐπειδὴ [it was not long ago when] χιτῶνάς τε λινοῦς ἐπαύσαντο φοροῦντες [they ceased wearing linen tunics] καὶ χρυσῶν τεττίγων ἐνέρσει κρωβύλον ἀναδούμενοι τῶν ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ τριχῶν [and fastening up the hair on their heads with a knot by inserting golden cicadas]. ἀφ’ οὗ καὶ Ἰώνων τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους κατὰ τὸ ξυγγενὲς ἐπὶ πολὺ αὕτη ἡ σκευὴ κατέσχεν [from which also this style of dress prevailed for a long time among the Ionians because of kinship].

μετρίᾳ δ’ αὖ ἐσθῆτι [And again with moderate dress] καὶ ἐς τὸν νῦν τρόπον [and in the present fashion] πρῶτοι Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐχρήσαντο [the Lacedaemonians first used] καὶ ἐς τὰ ἄλλα [and in other respects] πρὸς τοὺς πολλοὺς [in relation to the many] οἱ τὰ μείζω κεκτημένοι ἰσοδίαιτοι μάλιστα κατέστησαν [those possessing the greater means established themselves as living most simply].

ἐγυμνώθησάν τε πρῶτοι [And they first went naked] καὶ ἐς τὸ φανερὸν ἀποδύντες [and stripping off their clothes in public] λίπα μετὰ τοῦ γυμνάζεσθαι ἠλείψαντο [anointed themselves with oil along with exercising]. τὸ δὲ πάλαι [But formerly] καὶ ἐν τῷ Ὀλυμπικῷ ἀγῶνι [even at the Olympic games] διαζώματα ἔχοντες περὶ τὰ αἰδοῖα οἱ ἀθληταὶ ἠγωνίζοντο [the athletes used to compete wearing loincloths around their private parts]. καὶ οὐ πολλὰ ἔτη ἐπειδὴ πέπαυται [and it is not many years since this ceased]. ἔτι δὲ καὶ ἐν τοῖς βαρβάροις ἔστιν οἷς νῦν [Moreover, even now among the barbarians, among some] καὶ μάλιστα τοῖς Ἀσιανοῖς [and especially among the Asians] πυγμῆς καὶ πάλης ἆθλα τίθεται [prizes for boxing and wrestling are established]. καὶ διεζωμένοι τοῦτο δρῶσιν [and they do this wearing loincloths].

πολλὰ δ’ ἂν καὶ ἄλλα τις ἀποδείξειε [And one would show many other things] τὸ παλαιὸν Ἑλληνικὸν ὁμοιότροπα τῷ νῦν βαρβαρικῷ διαιτώμενον [the ancient Greek way of life being similar to the present barbarian way of life].

τῶν δὲ πόλεων ὅσαι μὲν νεώτατα ᾠκίσθησαν [Of the cities, as many as were founded most recently] καὶ ἤδη πλωιμωτέρων ὄντων [and when navigation was already better] περιουσίας μᾶλλον ἔχουσαι χρημάτων [having more abundant wealth] ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς τοῖς αἰγιαλοῖς τείχεσιν ἐκτίζοντο [they were founded with walls on the coasts themselves] καὶ τοὺς ἰσθμοὺς ἀπελάμβανον [and took possession of the isthmuses] ἐμπορίας τε ἕνεκα [both for the sake of trade] καὶ τῆς πρὸς τοὺς προσοίκους ἕκαστοι ἰσχύος [and each for the sake of strength against their neighbors]. αἱ δὲ παλαιαὶ [But the old cities] διὰ τὴν λῃστείαν ἐπὶ πολὺ ἀντίσχουσαν [because of piracy prevailing for a long time] ἀπὸ θαλάσσης μᾶλλον ᾠκίσθησαν [were founded further from the sea]. αἵ τε ἐν ταῖς νήσοις [both those in the islands] καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἠπείροις [and those on the mainland] (ἔφερον γὰρ ἀλλήλους τε [for they plundered each other] καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ὅσοι ὄντες οὐ θαλάσσιοι κάτω ᾤκουν [and of the others as many as, being not seafaring, dwelled below]) καὶ μέχρι τοῦδε ἔτι ἀνῳκισμένοι εἰσίν [and up to this day are still situated inland].

καὶ οὐχ ἧσσον λῃσταὶ ἦσαν οἱ νησιῶται [And the islanders were no less pirates] Κᾶρές τε ὄντες καὶ Φοίνικες [being Carians and Phoenicians]. οὗτοι γὰρ δὴ τὰς πλείστας τῶν νήσων ᾤκησαν [For these indeed inhabited most of the islands]. μαρτύριον δέ [And there is proof]. Δήλου γὰρ καθαιρομένης ὑπὸ Ἀθηναίων [For when Delos was being purified by the Athenians] ἐν τῷδε τῷ πολέμῳ [in this war] καὶ τῶν θηκῶν ἀναιρεθεισῶν [and the tombs were being removed] ὅσαι ἦσαν τῶν τεθνεώτων ἐν τῇ νήσῳ [as many as were of the dead on the island], ὑπὲρ ἥμισυ Κᾶρες ἐφάνησαν [more than half appeared to be Carians]. γνωσθέντες τῇ τε σκευῇ τῶν ὅπλων ξυντεθαμμένῃ [being recognized both by the style of their buried weapons] καὶ τῷ τρόπῳ ᾧ νῦν ἔτι θάπτουσιν [and by the manner in which they still bury even now].

καταστάντος δὲ τοῦ Μίνω ναυτικοῦ [But when the navy of Minos was established] πλωιμώτερα ἐγένετο παρ’ ἀλλήλους [navigation became safer among one another] (οἱ γὰρ ἐκ τῶν νήσων κακοῦργοι ἀνέστησαν ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ [for the malefactors from the islands were expelled by him] ὅτεπερ καὶ τὰς πολλὰς αὐτῶν κατῴκιζε [at which time he also settled most of the islands]).

καὶ οἱ παρὰ θάλασσαν ἄνθρωποι [And the men by the sea] μᾶλλον ἤδη τὴν κτῆσιν τῶν χρημάτων ποιούμενοι [already making the acquisition of wealth more] βεβαιότερον ᾤκουν [lived more securely] καί τινες καὶ τείχη περιεβάλλοντο [and some also built walls around themselves] ὡς πλουσιώτεροι ἑαυτῶν γιγνόμενοι [as they became wealthier]. ἐφιέμενοι γὰρ τῶν κερδῶν [For desiring gain] οἵ τε ἥσσους ὑπέμενον τὴν τῶν κρεισσόνων δουλείαν [the weaker submitted to the slavery of the stronger] οἵ τε δυνατώτεροι περιουσίας ἔχοντες [and the more powerful, having surplus] προσεποιοῦντο ὑπηκόους τὰς ἐλάσσους πόλεις [made the smaller cities subjects].

καὶ ἐν τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ μᾶλλον ἤδη ὄντες [And being in this state more already] ὕστερον χρόνῳ ἐπὶ Τροίαν ἐστράτευσαν [later in time they campaigned against Troy].

Ἀγαμέμνων τέ μοι δοκεῖ [And Agamemnon seems to me] τῶν τότε δυνάμει προύχων [having been preeminent in power at that time] καὶ οὐ τοσοῦτον τοῖς Τυνδάρεω ὅρκοις κατειλημμένους τοὺς Ἑλένης μνηστῆρας ἄγων [and not so much leading those suitors of Helen bound by the oaths to Tyndareus] τὸν στόλον ἀγεῖραι [to have gathered the expedition].

λέγουσι δὲ καὶ οἱ τὰ σαφέστατα Πελοποννησίων μνήμῃ παρὰ τῶν πρότερον δεδεγμένοι [And those of the Peloponnesians who have received the clearest accounts by recollection from the men of former times say] Πέλοπά τε πρῶτον [that Pelops first] πλήθει χρημάτων [by abundance of wealth] ἃ ἦλθεν ἐκ τῆς Ἀσίας ἔχων [which he brought from Asia having] ἐς ἀνθρώπους ἀπόρους [to poor men] δύναμιν περιποιησάμενον [acquired power] τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν τῆς χώρας ἔπηλυν ὄντα ὅμως σχεῖν [although being a foreigner, to have given the name to the land]. καὶ ὕστερον τοῖς ἐκγόνοις ἔτι μείζω ξυνενεχθῆναι [and later still greater power befell his descendants]. Εὐρυσθέως μὲν ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ ὑπὸ Ἡρακλειδῶν ἀποθανόντος [when Eurystheus died in Attica at the hands of the Heraclids], Ἀτρέως δὲ μητρὸς ἀδελφοῦ ὄντος αὐτῷ [and Atreus being a brother of his mother] καὶ ἐπιτρέψαντος Εὐρυσθέως [and Eurystheus entrusting] ὅτ’ ἐστράτευε [when he was campaigning] Μυκήνας τε καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν [both Mycenae and the kingship] κατὰ τὸ οἰκεῖον Ἀτρεῖ [to Atreus because of their kinship] (τυγχάνειν δὲ αὐτὸν φεύγοντα τὸν πατέρα [and he happened to be in exile fleeing his father] διὰ τὸν Χρυσίππου θάνατον [because of the death of Chrysippus]). καὶ ὡς οὐκέτι ἀνεχώρησεν Εὐρυσθεύς [and when Eurystheus no longer returned] βουλομένων καὶ τῶν Μυκηναίων [the Mycenaeans also wanting] φόβῳ τῶν Ἡρακλειδῶν [from fear of the Heraclids] καὶ ἅμα δυνατὸν δοκοῦντα εἶναι [and at the same time thinking him to be capable] καὶ τὸ πλῆθος τεθεραπευκότα [and having courted the multitude] τῶν Μυκηναίων τε καὶ ὅσων Εὐρυσθεὺς ἦρχε [of the Mycenaeans and all whom Eurystheus ruled] τὴν βασιλείαν Ἀτρέα παραλαβεῖν [that Atreus take over the kingship] καὶ τῶν Περσειδῶν τοὺς Πελοπίδας μείζους καταστῆναι [and the Pelopids to become greater than the Perseids].

ἅ μοι δοκεῖ Ἀγαμέμνων παραλαβὼν [Which things Agamemnon seems to me to have received] καὶ ναυτικῷ ἅμα ἐπὶ πλέον τῶν ἄλλων ἰσχύσας [and having become more powerful at the same time with a navy beyond the others], τὴν στρατείαν [the expedition] οὐ χάριτι τὸ πλέον ἢ φόβῳ ξυναγαγὼν ποιήσασθαι [to have made, having gathered it not so much by favor than by fear].

φαίνεται γὰρ ναυσί τε πλείσταις αὐτὸς ἀφικόμενος [For he appears having arrived himself with the most ships] καὶ Ἀρκάσι προσπαρασχών [and having furnished Arcadians besides] ὡς Ὅμηρος τοῦτο δεδήλωκεν [as Homer has shown this] εἴ τῳ ἱκανὸς τεκμηριῶσαι [if anyone is capable of judging this evidence]. καὶ ἐν τοῦ σκήπτρου ἅμα τῇ παραδόσει εἴρηκεν αὐτὸν [And at the same time with the handing over of the scepter he has said that he] πολλῇσι νήσοισι καὶ Ἄργεϊ παντὶ ἀνάσσειν [rules over many islands and all Argos]. οὐκ ἂν οὖν νήσων ἔξω τῶν περιοικίδων [Therefore he would not rule over islands beyond the neighboring ones] (αὗται δὲ οὐκ ἂν πολλαὶ εἶεν [and these would not be many]) ἠπειρώτης ὢν ἐκράτει [being a mainlander, he ruled them] εἰ μή τι καὶ ναυτικὸν εἶχεν [unless he also had a navy]. εἰκάζειν δὲ χρὴ καὶ ταύτῃ τῇ στρατείᾳ [And it is necessary to conjecture also by this expedition] οἷα ἦν τὰ πρὸ αὐτῆς [what sort the things before it were]. καὶ ὅτι μὲν Μυκῆναι μικρὸν ἦν [And that Mycenae was small] ἢ εἴ τι τῶν τότε πόλισμα νῦν μὴ ἀξιόχρεων δοκεῖ εἶναι [or if any of the settlements at that time now seems to be not considerable], οὐκ ἀκριβεῖ ἄν τις σημείῳ χρώμενος ἀπιστοίη [no one, using this as a precise indication, would disbelieve] μὴ γενέσθαι τὸν στόλον τοσοῦτον [that the expedition was not as great] ὅσον οἵ τε ποιηταὶ εἰρήκασι καὶ ὁ λόγος κατέχει [as both the poets have said and the account holds].

Λακεδαιμονίων γὰρ [For of the Lacedaemonians] εἰ ἡ πόλις ἐρημωθείη [if the city were to become deserted] λειφθείη δὲ τά τε ἱερὰ [and were left the temples] καὶ τῆς κατασκευῆς τὰ ἐδάφη [and the foundations of the buildings], πολλὴν ἂν οἶμαι ἀπιστίαν τῆς δυνάμεως [I think there would be much disbelief of their power] προελθόντος πολλοῦ χρόνου [after much time has passed] τοῖς ἔπειτα [for those after] πρὸς τὸ κλέος αὐτῶν εἶναι [regarding their fame] (καίτοι [although] Πελοποννήσου τῶν πέντε τὰς δύο μοίρας νέμονται [they occupy two-fifths of the Peloponnese], τῆς τε ξυμπάσης ἡγοῦνται [and are leaders of all of it] καὶ τῶν ἔξω ξυμμάχων πολλῶν [and of many outside allies]· ὅμως δὲ [nevertheless] οὔτε ξυνοικισθείσης πόλεως [neither as a city settled together] οὔτε ἱεροῖς καὶ κατασκευαῖς πολυτελέσι χρησαμένης [nor as having used temples and expensive buildings], κατὰ κώμας δὲ [but dwelling by villages] τῷ παλαιῷ τῆς Ἑλλάδος τρόπῳ οἰκισθείσης [in the ancient manner of Greece] φαίνοιτ’ ἂν ὑποδεεστέρα [it would appear inferior]), Ἀθηναίων δὲ τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο παθόντων [but if the Athenians suffered this same thing] διπλασίαν ἂν τὴν δύναμιν εἰκάζεσθαι [their power would be estimated as double] ἀπὸ τῆς φανερᾶς ὄψεως τῆς πόλεως [from the evident sight of the city] ἢ ἔστιν [than it is].

οὔκουν ἀπιστεῖν εἰκός [Therefore it is likely to disbelieve] οὐδὲ τὰς ὄψεις τῶν πόλεων μᾶλλον σκοπεῖν [nor to consider the appearances of the cities more] ἢ τὰς δυνάμεις [than the powers]. νομίζειν δὲ τὴν στρατείαν ἐκείνην [But to think that the expedition] μεγίστην μὲν γενέσθαι τῶν πρὸ αὑτῆς [was the greatest of those before it] λειπομένην δὲ τῶν νῦν [but inferior to those of today]. τῇ Ὁμήρου αὖ ποιήσει [by the poetry again of Homer] εἴ τι χρὴ κἀνταῦθα πιστεύειν [if it is necessary to trust in anything here]. ἣν εἰκὸς ἐπὶ τὸ μεῖζον μὲν [which is likely to the greater degree] ποιητὴν ὄντα κοσμῆσαι [being a poet, to have embellished] ὅμως δὲ φαίνεται καὶ οὕτως ἐνδεεστέρα [nevertheless it appears even thus to be inferior].

πεποίηκε γὰρ [For he has represented] χιλίων καὶ διακοσίων νεῶν [of 1200 ships] τὰς μὲν Βοιωτῶν [those of the Boeotians] εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατὸν ἀνδρῶν [with 120 men], τὰς δὲ Φιλοκτήτου πεντήκοντα [and those of Philoctetes with fifty], δηλῶν [indicating], ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ [as it seems to me], τὰς μεγίστας καὶ ἐλαχίστας [the largest and smallest]. ἄλλων γοῦν μεγέθους πέρι [at any rate, concerning the size of others] ἐν νεῶν καταλόγῳ οὐκ ἐμνήσθη [in the catalogue of ships he did not mention]. αὐτερέται δὲ ὅτι ἦσαν [And that they were self-equipped] καὶ μάχιμοι πάντες [and all fighting men] ἐν ταῖς Φιλοκτήτου ναυσὶ δεδήλωκεν [he has shown in the ships of Philoctetes]. τοξότας γὰρ πάντας πεποίηκε τοὺς προσκώπους [For he has made all the rowers archers]. περίνεως δὲ οὐκ εἰκὸς πολλοὺς ξυμπλεῖν [And it is not likely that many superfluous men sailed with them] ἔξω τῶν βασιλέων [apart from the kings] καὶ τῶν μάλιστα ἐν τέλει [and those most in authority], ἄλλως τε καὶ μέλλοντας πέλαγος περαιώσεσθαι [especially since they were about to cross the sea] μετὰ σκευῶν πολεμικῶν [with military equipment], οὐδ’ αὖ τὰ πλοῖα κατάφαρκτα ἔχοντας [nor again having decked ships], ἀλλὰ τῷ παλαιῷ τρόπῳ [but in the ancient manner] λῃστικώτερον παρεσκευασμένα [equipped more like pirates].

πρὸς τὰς μεγίστας δ’ οὖν καὶ ἐλαχίστας ναῦς [Therefore in relation to the largest and the smallest ships] τὸ μέσον σκοποῦντι [considering the average] οὐ πολλοὶ φαίνονται ἐλθόντες [not many seem to have come], ὡς ἀπὸ πάσης τῆς Ἑλλάδος κοινῇ πεμπόμενοι [as having been sent in common from all Greece].

αἴτιον δ’ ἦν οὐχ ἡ ὀλιγανθρωπία τοσοῦτον [And the cause was not lack of men so much] ὅσον ἡ ἀχρηματία [as lack of money]. τῆς γὰρ τροφῆς ἀπορίᾳ [For because of lack of food] τόν τε στρατὸν ἐλάσσω ἤγαγον [they led a smaller army] καὶ ὅσον ἤλπιζον αὐτόθεν [and as much as they hoped from that very place] πολεμοῦντα βιοτεύσειν [fighting to live off the land]. ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἀφικόμενοι μάχῃ ἐκράτησαν [but when, having arrived, they prevailed in battle] (δῆλον δέ [and it is clear]· τὸ γὰρ ἔρυμα τῷ στρατοπέδῳ οὐκ ἂν ἐτειχίσαντο [for they would not have fortified their camp]), φαίνονται δ’ οὐδ’ ἐνταῦθα πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει χρησάμενοι [and they appear not even then having used their full force]. ἀλλὰ πρὸς γεωργίαν τῆς Χερσονήσου τραπόμενοι [but having turned to farming the Chersonese] καὶ λῃστείαν τῆς τροφῆς ἀπορίᾳ [and to piracy because of the lack of food]. ᾗ καὶ μᾶλλον οἱ Τρῶες [by which also the more the Trojans] αὐτῶν διεσπαρμένων [when they were scattered] τὰ δέκα ἔτη ἀντεῖχον βίᾳ [held out by force for ten years]. τοῖς αἰεὶ ὑπολειπομένοις ἀντίπαλοι ὄντες [being a match for those always remaining behind].

περιουσίαν δὲ [But if they had come] εἰ ἦλθον ἔχοντες τροφῆς [having an abundance of food] καὶ ὄντες ἁθρόοι [and being united] ἄνευ λῃστείας καὶ γεωργίας [without piracy and farming] ξυνεχῶς τὸν πόλεμον διέφερον [they had continued the war constantly], ῥᾳδίως ἂν μάχῃ κρατοῦντες εἷλον [easily prevailing in battle, they would have captured it]. οἵ γε καὶ οὐχ ἁθρόοι [they who even not united] ἀλλὰ μέρει τῷ αἰεὶ παρόντι ἀντεῖχον [but with the part always present held out]. πολιορκίᾳ δ’ ἂν προσκαθεζόμενοι [And sitting down in siege] ἐν ἐλάσσονί τε χρόνῳ καὶ ἀπονώτερον τὴν Τροίαν εἷλον [they would have taken Troy in less time and with less effort]. ἀλλὰ δι’ ἀχρηματίαν [but because of lack of money] τά τε πρὸ τούτων ἀσθενῆ ἦν [the things before these were weak] καὶ αὐτά γε δὴ ταῦτα [and these very things] ὀνομαστότατα τῶν πρὶν γενόμενα [most famous of those having occurred before] δηλοῦται τοῖς ἔργοις ὑποδεέστερα ὄντα τῆς φήμης [are shown by the deeds to be less than the reputation] καὶ τοῦ νῦν περὶ αὐτῶν διὰ τοὺς ποιητὰς λόγου κατεσχηκότος [and of the account now prevailing concerning them because of the poets].

ἀλλὰ δι’ ἀχρηματίαν τά τε πρὸ τούτων ἀσθενῆ ἦν [But because of lack of money the things before these were weak] καὶ αὐτά γε δὴ ταῦτα [and these very things] ὀνομαστότατα τῶν πρὶν γενόμενα [most famous of those having occurred before] δηλοῦται τοῖς ἔργοις ὑποδεέστερα ὄντα τῆς φήμης [are shown by the deeds to be less than the reputation] καὶ τοῦ νῦν περὶ αὐτῶν διὰ τοὺς ποιητὰς λόγου κατεσχηκότος [and of the account now prevailing concerning them because of the poets].

ἐπεὶ καὶ μετὰ τὰ Τρωικὰ [Since even after the Trojan War] ἡ Ἑλλὰς ἔτι μετανίστατό τε καὶ κατῳκίζετο [Greece was still migrating and settling down], ὥστε μὴ ἡσυχάσασαν αὐξηθῆναι [so as not, having become peaceful, to have increased].

ἥ τε γὰρ ἀναχώρησις τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἐξ Ἰλίου [For the return of the Hellenes from Troy] χρονία γενομένη [having become protracted] πολλὰ ἐνεόχμωσε [stirred up many things] καὶ στάσεις ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ ἐγίγνοντο [and factions in the cities generally occurred]. ἀφ’ ὧν ἐκπίπτοντες [from which, being driven out] τὰς πόλεις ἔκτιζον [they founded cities].

Βοιωτοί τε γὰρ οἱ νῦν [For the present Boeotians] ἑξηκοστῷ ἔτει μετὰ Ἰλίου ἅλωσιν [in the sixtieth year after the capture of Troy] ἐξ Ἄρνης ἀναστάντες ὑπὸ Θεσσαλῶν [having departed from Arne because of the Thessalians] τὴν νῦν μὲν Βοιωτίαν [what is now Boeotia] πρότερον δὲ Καδμηίδα γῆν καλουμένην ᾤκισαν [formerly called Cadmean land, settled] (ἦν δὲ αὐτῶν καὶ ἀποδασμὸς πρότερον ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ [and there was also an allotment of them previously in this land] ἀφ’ ὧν καὶ ἐς Ἴλιον ἐστράτευσαν [from which they also campaigned to Troy]). Δωριῆς τε [and the Dorians] ὀγδοηκοστῷ ἔτει ξὺν Ἡρακλείδαις Πελοπόννησον ἔσχον [in the eightieth year together with the Heraclids occupied Peloponnese].

μόλις τε ἐν πολλῷ χρόνῳ ἡσυχάσασα ἡ Ἑλλάς [And Greece, having with difficulty become peaceful in much time] βεβαίως καὶ οὐκέτι ἀνισταμένη [securely and no longer being unsettled] ἀποικίας ἐξέπεμψε [sent out colonies]. καὶ Ἴωνας μὲν Ἀθηναῖοι [and the Athenians colonized the Ionians] καὶ νησιωτῶν τοὺς πολλούς [and most of the islanders]. Ἰταλίας δὲ καὶ Σικελίας τὸ πλεῖστον [and the Peloponnesians colonized most of Italy and Sicily] Πελοποννήσιοι [Peloponnesians] τῆς τε ἄλλης Ἑλλάδος ἔστιν ἃ χωρία [and some places of the rest of Greece]. πάντα δὲ ταῦτα [and all these] ὕστερον τῶν Τρωικῶν ἐκτίσθη [were founded after the Trojan war].

δυνατωτέρας δὲ γιγνομένης τῆς Ἑλλάδος [As Greece was becoming more powerful] καὶ τῶν χρημάτων τὴν κτῆσιν ἔτι μᾶλλον ἢ πρότερον ποιουμένης [and making the acquisition of wealth still more than before] τὰ πολλὰ τυραννίδες ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι καθίσταντο [tyrannies were mostly being established in the cities] τῶν προσόδων μειζόνων γιγνομένων [as revenues were becoming greater] (πρότερον δὲ ἦσαν ἐπὶ ῥητοῖς γέρασι πατρικαὶ βασιλεῖαι [and previously there were hereditary kingships with defined prerogatives]). ναυτικά τε ἐξηρτύετο ἡ Ἑλλάς [and Greece was equipping navies] καὶ τῆς θαλάσσης μᾶλλον ἀντείχοντο [and they held on to the sea more].

πρῶτοι δὲ Κορίνθιοι λέγονται [And the Corinthians are said first] ἐγγύτατα τοῦ νῦν τρόπου μεταχειρίσαι τὰ περὶ τὰς ναῦς [to have managed the things concerning ships nearest to the present way] καὶ τριήρεις ἐν Κορίνθῳ πρῶτον τῆς Ἑλλάδος ναυπηγηθῆναι [and triremes to have been built first in Corinth in Greece].

φαίνεται δὲ καὶ Σαμίοις Ἀμεινοκλῆς Κορίνθιος ναυπηγὸς ναῦς ποιήσας τέσσαρας [And Ameinocles, a Corinthian shipwright, appears having made four ships for the Samians]. ἔτη δ’ ἐστὶ μάλιστα τριακόσια [and it is about three hundred years] ἐς τὴν τελευτὴν τοῦδε τοῦ πολέμου [to the end of this war] ὅτε Ἀμεινοκλῆς Σαμίοις ἦλθεν [when Ameinocles came to Samos].

ναυμαχία τε παλαιτάτη ὧν ἴσμεν γίγνεται [And the oldest sea battle of which we know happens] Κορινθίων πρὸς Κερκυραίους [between Corinthians and Corcyraeans]. ἔτη δὲ μάλιστα καὶ ταύτῃ ἑξήκοντα καὶ διακόσιά ἐστι [and there are about 260 years in this case also] μέχρι τοῦ αὐτοῦ χρόνου [up to the same time].

οἰκοῦντες γὰρ τὴν πόλιν οἱ Κορίνθιοι ἐπὶ τοῦ Ἰσθμοῦ [For the Corinthians inhabiting the city on the Isthmus] αἰεὶ δή ποτε ἐμπόριον εἶχον [always then had a trading center] τῶν Ἑλλήνων τὸ πάλαι [for the Greeks of old] κατὰ γῆν τὰ πλείω ἢ κατὰ θάλασσαν [more by land than by sea], τῶν τε ἐντὸς Πελοποννήσου καὶ τῶν ἔξω [of those both inside the Peloponnese and outside], διὰ τῆς ἐκείνων παρ’ ἀλλήλους ἐπιμισγόντων [mixing with one another by means of them]. χρήμασί τε δυνατοὶ ἦσαν [and they were powerful in wealth], ὡς καὶ τοῖς παλαιοῖς ποιηταῖς δεδήλωται [as also to the old poets has been shown]. ἀφνειὸν γὰρ ἐπωνόμασαν τὸ χωρίον [for they called the place wealthy]. ἐπειδή τε οἱ Ἕλληνες μᾶλλον ἔπλῳζον [and when the Greeks sailed more] τὰς ναῦς κτησάμενοι τὸ λῃστικὸν καθῄρουν [having acquired the ships, they swept away piracy] καὶ ἐμπόριον παρέχοντες ἀμφότερα [and providing a trading center for both] δυνατὴν ἔσχον χρημάτων προσόδῳ τὴν πόλιν [they had the city powerful by income of wealth].

καὶ Ἴωσιν ὕστερον [And for the Ionians later] πολὺ γίγνεται ναυτικόν [there arises a large navy] ἐπὶ Κύρου [in the time of Cyrus] Περσῶν πρώτου βασιλεύοντος [first king of the Persians] καὶ Καμβύσου τοῦ υἱέος αὐτοῦ [and of Cambyses his son]. τῆς τε καθ’ ἑαυτοὺς θαλάσσης [and of the sea around them] Κύρῳ πολεμοῦντες ἐκράτησάν τινα χρόνον [fighting against Cyrus they held control for a time]. καὶ Πολυκράτης Σάμου τυραννῶν [And Polycrates, tyrant of Samos] ἐπὶ Καμβύσου [in the time of Cambyses] ναυτικῷ ἰσχύων [being powerful with a navy] ἄλλας τε τῶν νήσων ὑπηκόους ἐποιήσατο [made other of the islands subject] καὶ Ῥήνειαν ἑλὼν ἀνέθηκε [and, having taken Rhenea, dedicated it] τῷ Ἀπόλλωνι τῷ Δηλίῳ [to Delian Apollo]. Φωκαῆς τε [And the Phocaeans] Μασσαλίαν οἰκίζοντες [founding Massalia] Καρχηδονίους ἐνίκων ναυμαχοῦντες [were victorious over the Carthaginians in a sea battle].

δυνατώτατα γὰρ ταῦτα τῶν ναυτικῶν ἦν [For these were the most powerful of the navies]. φαίνεται δὲ καὶ ταῦτα [And these appear] πολλαῖς γενεαῖς ὕστερα γενόμενα τῶν Τρωικῶν [having arisen many generations after the Trojan War] τριήρεσι μὲν ὀλίγαις χρώμενα [using few triremes] πεντηκοντόροις δ’ ἔτι καὶ πλοίοις μακροῖς ἐξηρτυμένα [but still equipped with fifty-oared ships and long boats] ὥσπερ ἐκεῖνα [like those].

ὀλίγον τε πρὸ τῶν Μηδικῶν [And a little before the Median Wars] καὶ τοῦ Δαρείου θανάτου [and the death of Darius], ὃς μετὰ Καμβύσην Περσῶν ἐβασίλευσε [who after Cambyses became king of the Persians], τριήρεις περί τε Σικελίαν τοῖς τυράννοις ἐς πλῆθος ἐγένοντο [triremes around Sicily became numerous for the tyrants] καὶ Κερκυραίοις [and for the Corcyraeans]. ταῦτα γὰρ τελευταῖα πρὸ τῆς Ξέρξου στρατείας ναυτικὰ ἀξιόλογα ἐν τῇ Ἑλλάδι κατέστη [for these were the last considerable navies established in Greece before the expedition of Xerxes].

Αἰγινῆται γὰρ καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι [For the Aeginetans and the Athenians] καὶ εἴ τινες ἄλλοι [and if any others] βραχέα ἐκέκτηντο [possessed few] καὶ τούτων τὰ πολλὰ πεντηκοντόρους [and most of these fifty-oared ships]. ὀψέ τε [and late] ἀφ’ οὗ Ἀθηναίους Θεμιστοκλῆς ἔπεισεν [since Themistocles persuaded the Athenians] Αἰγινήταις πολεμοῦντας [being at war with the Aeginetans] καὶ ἅμα τοῦ βαρβάρου προσδοκίμου ὄντος [and at the same time with the barbarian being expected] τὰς ναῦς ποιήσασθαι [to build the ships] αἷσπερ καὶ ἐναυμάχησαν [with which they also fought the sea battle]. καὶ αὗται οὔπω εἶχον διὰ πάσης καταστρώματα [and these not yet had decks throughout].

τὰ μὲν οὖν ναυτικὰ τῶν Ἑλλήνων τοιαῦτα ἦν [The navies of the Greeks therefore were such] τά τε παλαιὰ καὶ τὰ ὕστερον γενόμενα [both the old ones and those having arisen later]. ἰσχὺν δὲ περιεποιήσαντο ὅμως οὐκ ἐλαχίστην [Nevertheless they acquired not the least power] οἱ προσσχόντες αὐτοῖς [those having applied themselves to them] χρημάτων τε προσόδῳ καὶ ἄλλων ἀρχῇ [both by revenue of money and by rule over others]. ἐπιπλέοντες γὰρ τὰς νήσους κατεστρέφοντο [for sailing against the islands they subdued them] καὶ μάλιστα ὅσοι μὴ διαρκῆ εἶχον χώραν [and especially those who did not have sufficient land].

κατὰ γῆν δὲ πόλεμος [But a war by land] ὅθεν τις καὶ δύναμις παρεγένετο [from which some power also arose] οὐδεὶς ξυνέστη [no one undertook]. πάντες δὲ ἦσαν ὅσοι καὶ ἐγένοντο [and all that also occurred were] πρὸς ὁμόρους τοὺς σφετέρους ἑκάστοις [against their own respective neighbors] καὶ ἐκδήμους στρατείας [and expeditions abroad] πολὺ ἀπὸ τῆς ἑαυτῶν [far from their own land] ἐπ’ ἄλλων καταστροφῇ οὐκ ἐξῇσαν οἱ Ἕλληνες [the Greeks did not go out for the subjugation of others]. οὐ γὰρ ξυνειστήκεσαν πρὸς τὰς μεγίστας πόλεις ὑπήκοοι [For they had not been united as subjects to the greatest cities] οὐδ’ αὖ αὐτοὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ἴσης κοινὰς στρατείας ἐποιοῦντο [nor again did they themselves, from a position of equality, make joint expeditions]. κατ’ ἀλλήλους δὲ μᾶλλον [but they warred against one another more] ὡς ἕκαστοι οἱ ἀστυγείτονες ἐπολέμουν [each as neighbors warred].

μάλιστα δὲ ἐς τὸν πάλαι ποτὲ γενόμενον πόλεμον [And especially in the war having occurred long ago] Χαλκιδέων καὶ Ἐρετριῶν [of the Chalcidians and Eretrians] καὶ τὸ ἄλλο Ἑλληνικὸν ἐς ξυμμαχίαν ἑκατέρων διέστη [and the rest of the Greeks were divided into alliance with one or the other of them].

ἐπεγένετο δὲ ἄλλοις τε ἄλλοθι κωλύματα [And there arose for others elsewhere hindrances] μὴ αὐξηθῆναι [to being increased] καὶ Ἴωσι προχωρησάντων ἐπὶ μέγα τῶν πραγμάτων [and when the affairs of the Ionians had advanced to a great degree] Κῦρος καὶ ἡ Περσικὴ βασιλεία [Cyrus and the Persian kingdom] Κροῖσον καθελοῦσα [having taken down Croesus] καὶ ὅσα ἐντὸς Ἅλυος ποταμοῦ πρὸς θάλασσαν [and all within the Halys river towards the sea] ἐπεστράτευσε [made an expedition] καὶ τὰς ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ πόλεις ἐδούλωσε [and enslaved the cities on the mainland]. Δαρεῖός τε ὕστερον [and Darius later] τῷ Φοινίκων ναυτικῷ κρατῶν [being master of the Phoenician fleet] καὶ τὰς νήσους [also the islands].

τύραννοί τε ὅσοι ἦσαν ἐν ταῖς Ἑλληνικαῖς πόλεσι [And as many tyrants as there were in the Greek cities] τὸ ἐφ’ ἑαυτῶν μόνον προορώμενοι [looking out only for themselves] ἔς τε τὸ σῶμα καὶ ἐς τὸ τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον αὔξειν [both with respect to their person and to increasing their own household] δι’ ἀσφαλείας ὅσον ἐδύναντο μάλιστα τὰς πόλεις ᾤκουν [managed the cities as much as they could through security]. ἐπράχθη δὲ οὐδὲν ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἔργον ἀξιόλογον [And no noteworthy deed was done by them] εἰ μὴ εἴ τι πρὸς περιοίκους τοὺς αὐτῶν ἑκάστοις [unless something against their own respective neighbors]. οἱ γὰρ ἐν Σικελίᾳ ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἐχώρησαν δυνάμεως [For those in Sicily advanced most in power]. οὕτω πανταχόθεν ἡ Ἑλλὰς ἐπὶ πολὺν χρόνον κατείχετο [Thus from everywhere Greece was held down for a long time] μήτε κοινῇ φανερὸν μηδὲν κατεργάζεσθαι [neither jointly accomplishing anything noteworthy] κατὰ πόλεις τε ἀτολμοτέρα εἶναι [and with respect to cities being rather timid].

ἐπειδὴ δὲ οἵ τε Ἀθηναίων τύραννοι [But when the tyrants of the Athenians] καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς ἄλλης Ἑλλάδος [and those from the rest of Greece] ἐπὶ πολὺ καὶ πρὶν τυραννευθείσης [having been ruled by tyrants for a long time and before] οἱ πλεῖστοι καὶ τελευταῖοι [the most and the last] πλὴν τῶν ἐν Σικελίᾳ [except those in Sicily] ὑπὸ Λακεδαιμονίων κατελύθησαν [were deposed by the Lacedaemonians] (ἡ γὰρ Λακεδαίμων [for Lacedaemon] μετὰ τὴν κτίσιν τῶν νῦν ἐνοικούντων αὐτὴν Δωριῶν [after the founding by the Dorians who now inhabit it] ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ὧν ἴσμεν χρόνον στασιάσασα [although having been in faction for the longest time that we know] ὅμως ἐκ παλαιτάτου καὶ ηὐνομήθη [nevertheless from earliest times was well-governed] καὶ αἰεὶ ἀτυράννευτος ἦν [and was always free of tyrants]· ἔτη γάρ ἐστι μάλιστα τετρακόσια καὶ ὀλίγῳ πλείω [for it is about four hundred years and a little more] ἐς τὴν τελευτὴν τοῦδε τοῦ πολέμου [to the end of this war] ἀφ’ οὗ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τῇ αὐτῇ πολιτείᾳ χρῶνται [since the Lacedaemonians use the same constitution] καὶ δι’ αὐτὸ δυνάμενοι [and being able on account of it] καὶ τὰ ἐν ταῖς ἄλλαις πόλεσι καθίστασαν [they also established things in the other cities]), μετὰ δὲ τὴν τῶν τυράννων κατάλυσιν ἐκ τῆς Ἑλλάδος [and after the destruction of the tyrants from Greece] οὐ πολλοῖς ἔτεσιν ὕστερον [not many years afterward] καὶ ἡ ἐν Μαραθῶνι μάχη Μήδων πρὸς Ἀθηναίους ἐγένετο [the battle at Marathon of the Medes against the Athenians also took place].

δεκάτῳ δὲ ἔτει μετ’ αὐτὴν [And in the tenth year after it] αὖθις ὁ βάρβαρος [again the barbarian] τῷ μεγάλῳ στόλῳ [with the great expedition] ἐπὶ τὴν Ἑλλάδα [against Greece] δουλωσόμενος ἦλθεν [came to enslave it]. καὶ μεγάλου κινδύνου ἐπικρεμασθέντος [And with a great danger hanging over them] οἵ τε Λακεδαιμόνιοι τῶν ξυμπολεμησάντων Ἑλλήνων ἡγήσαντο [the Lacedaemonians led the Hellenes having fought together] δυνάμει προύχοντες [being preeminent in power] καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπιόντων τῶν Μήδων [and the Athenians, with the Medes advancing] διανοηθέντες ἐκλιπεῖν τὴν πόλιν [thinking to leave the city] καὶ ἀνασκευασάμενοι [and having packed up their belongings] ἐς τὰς ναῦς ἐσβάντες ναυτικοὶ ἐγένοντο [having embarked on the ships they became a naval power]. κοινῇ τε ἀπωσάμενοι τὸν βάρβαρον [And having repelled the barbarian in common], ὕστερον οὐ πολλῷ διεκρίθησαν [afterward they were distinguished not much] πρός τε Ἀθηναίους καὶ Λακεδαιμονίους [with respect to both Athenians and Lacedaemonians] οἵ τε ἀποστάντες βασιλέως Ἕλληνες [both the Hellenes who had revolted from the king] καὶ οἱ ξυμπολεμήσαντες [and those who had fought together]. δυνάμει γὰρ ταῦτα μέγιστα διεφάνη [for these things appeared greatest in power]. ἴσχυον γὰρ οἱ μὲν κατὰ γῆν οἱ δὲ ναυσίν [for the former were strong on land, the latter at sea].

καὶ ὀλίγον μὲν χρόνον ξυνέμεινεν ἡ ὁμαιχμία [And for a short time the alliance lasted] ἔπειτα διενεχθέντες [then, having disagreed] οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπολέμησαν [the Lacedaemonians and Athenians warred] μετὰ τῶν ξυμμάχων [with their allies] πρὸς ἀλλήλους [against each other]. καὶ τῶν ἄλλων Ἑλλήνων [and of the other Hellenes] εἴ τινές που διασταῖεν [if any were at odds anywhere] πρὸς τούτους ἤδη ἐχώρουν [they now went over to these]. ὥστε ἀπὸ τῶν Μηδικῶν ἐς τόνδε αἰεὶ τὸν πόλεμον [so that, from the Median Wars to this war always] τὰ μὲν σπενδόμενοι τὰ δὲ πολεμοῦντες [partly making peace, partly warring] ἢ ἀλλήλοις [either with one another] ἢ τοῖς ἑαυτῶν ξυμμάχοις ἀφισταμένοις [or with their own allies revolting] εὖ παρεσκευάσαντο τὰ πολέμια [they prepared well the implements of war] καὶ ἐμπειρότεροι ἐγένοντο [and they became more experienced] μετὰ κινδύνων τὰς μελέτας ποιούμενοι [making their practices with dangers].

καὶ οἱ μὲν Λακεδαιμόνιοι [And the Lacedaemonians] οὐχ ὑποτελεῖς ἔχοντες φόρου τοὺς ξυμμάχους [not having the allies paying tribute] ἡγοῦντο [led] κατ’ ὀλιγαρχίαν δὲ σφίσιν αὐτοῖς μόνον ἐπιτηδείως ὅπως πολιτεύσουσι θεραπεύοντες [but taking care advantageously for themselves only how they would manage the government] Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ [but the Athenians] ναῦς τε τῶν πόλεων τῷ χρόνῳ παραλαβόντες [in time taking over ships of the cities] πλὴν Χίων καὶ Λεσβίων [except Chians and Lesbians] καὶ χρήματα τοῖς πᾶσι τάξαντες φέρειν [and ordering all to contribute money]. καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς ἐς τόνδε τὸν πόλεμον ἡ ἰδία παρασκευὴ μείζων [and their own preparation for this war became greater] ἢ ὡς τὰ κράτιστά ποτε [than when they ever flourished most successfully] μετὰ ἀκραιφνοῦς τῆς ξυμμαχίας ἤνθησαν [with the alliance being at its height].

τὰ μὲν οὖν παλαιὰ τοιαῦτα ηὗρον [The old things therefore I found such] χαλεπὰ ὄντα παντὶ [being difficult for anyone] ἑξῆς τεκμηρίῳ πιστεῦσαι [to trust each piece of evidence]. οἱ γὰρ ἄνθρωποι τὰς ἀκοὰς τῶν προγεγενημένων [For men the reports of past events] καὶ ἢν ἐπιχώρια σφίσιν ᾖ [and even if they are local to them] ὁμοίως ἀβασανίστως παρ’ ἀλλήλων δέχονται [they receive similarly from one another without testing].

Ἀθηναίων γοῦν τὸ πλῆθος [The Athenian multitude at any rate] Ἵππαρχον οἴονται [think Hipparchus] ὑφ’ Ἁρμοδίου καὶ Ἀριστογείτονος [by Harmodius and Aristogeiton] τύραννον ὄντα ἀποθανεῖν [being tyrant, to have been killed] καὶ οὐκ ἴσασιν [and they do not know] ὅτι Ἱππίας μὲν πρεσβύτατος ὢν ἦρχε τῶν Πεισιστράτου υἱέων [that Hippias, being the eldest, ruled, of the sons of Peisistratus]. Ἵππαρχος δὲ καὶ Θεσσαλὸς ἀδελφοὶ ἦσαν αὐτοῦ [and Hipparchus and Thessalus were brothers of his]. ὑποτοπήσαντες δέ τι [But having suspected something] ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ [on that day] καὶ παραχρῆμα [and immediately] Ἁρμόδιος καὶ Ἀριστογείτων [Harmodius and Aristogeiton] ἐκ τῶν ξυνειδότων σφίσιν [from among their conspirators] Ἱππίᾳ μεμηνῦσθαι [that it had been reported to Hippias] τοῦ μὲν ἀπέσχοντο ὡς προειδότος [they kept away from the former as knowing beforehand]. βουλόμενοι δὲ πρὶν ξυλληφθῆναι [But wanting, before being arrested] δράσαντές τι καὶ κινδυνεῦσαι [having done something to also take a risk], τῷ Ἱππάρχῳ περιτυχόντες [having encountered Hipparchus] περὶ τὸ Λεωκόρειον καλούμενον [around what is called the Leocorium] τὴν Παναθηναϊκὴν πομπὴν διακοσμοῦντι ἀπέκτειναν [arranging the Panathenaic procession, they killed him].

πολλὰ δὲ καὶ ἄλλα [And many other things] ἔτι καὶ νῦν ὄντα [still existing even now] καὶ οὐ χρόνῳ ἀμνηστούμενα [and not to be forgotten in time] καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι Ἕλληνες οὐκ ὀρθῶς οἴονται [the other Hellenes also think incorrectly]. ὥσπερ [just as] τούς τε Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλέας [the kings of the Lacedaemonians] μὴ μιᾷ ψήφῳ προστίθεσθαι ἑκάτερον ἀλλὰ δυοῖν [that each adds not one vote but two] καὶ τὸν Πιτανάτην λόχον αὐτοῖς εἶναι [and that the Pitanate company is theirs], ὃς οὐδ’ ἐγένετο πώποτε [which never even existed]. οὕτως ἀταλαίπωρος τοῖς πολλοῖς ἡ ζήτησις τῆς ἀληθείας [Thus lacking in hardship for most is the search for truth] καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ἑτοῖμα μᾶλλον τρέπονται [and they turn rather to what is ready at hand].

ἐκ δὲ τῶν εἰρημένων τεκμηρίων ὅμως [Nevertheless from the stated proofs] τοιαῦτα ἄν τις νομίζων μάλιστα [someone thinking things such as these most of all] ἃ διῆλθον οὐχ ἁμαρτάνοι [which I have gone through, would not be mistaken] καὶ οὔτε ὡς ποιηταὶ ὑμνήκασι περὶ αὐτῶν [and neither as poets have sung about them] ἐπὶ τὸ μεῖζον κοσμοῦντες μᾶλλον πιστεύων [exaggerating for embellishment trusting more], οὔτε ὡς λογογράφοι ξυνέθεσαν [nor as logographers have composed] ἐπὶ τὸ προσαγωγότερον τῇ ἀκροάσει [making them more attractive to the listener] ἢ ἀληθέστερον [than truer], ὄντα ἀνεξέλεγκτα [being unprovable] καὶ τὰ πολλὰ ὑπὸ χρόνου αὐτῶν [and most of them by time] ἀπίστως ἐπὶ τὸ μυθῶδες ἐκνενικηκότα [having prevailed incredibly to the mythical]. ηὑρῆσθαι δὲ ἡγησάμενος ἐκ τῶν ἐπιφανεστάτων σημείων [but consideri

ηὑρῆσθαι δὲ ἡγησάμενος [but considering them to have been discovered] ἐκ τῶν ἐπιφανεστάτων σημείων [from the clearest indications] ὡς παλαιὰ εἶναι ἀποχρώντως [as old things sufficiently].

καὶ ὁ πόλεμος οὗτος [And this war] καίπερ τῶν ἀνθρώπων [although of men] ἐν ᾧ μὲν ἂν πολεμῶσι [in which they might be warring] τὸν παρόντα αἰεὶ μέγιστον κρινόντων [always judging the present one greatest] παυσαμένων δὲ τὰ ἀρχαῖα μᾶλλον θαυμαζόντων [but, having ceased, admiring the ancient things more], ἀπ’ αὐτῶν τῶν ἔργων σκοποῦσι δηλώσει ὅμως [nevertheless it will show from the very deeds considering them] μείζων γεγενημένος αὐτῶν [having become greater than them].

καὶ ὅσα μὲν λόγῳ εἶπον ἕκαστοι [And whatever things they said in words each] ἢ μέλλοντες πολεμήσειν [either being about to make war] ἢ ἐν αὐτῷ ἤδη ὄντες [or already being in it] χαλεπὸν τὴν ἀκρίβειαν αὐτὴν τῶν λεχθέντων διαμνημονεῦσαι ἦν [it was difficult to remember the very accuracy of the things said] ἐμοί τε [both for me] ὧν αὐτὸς ἤκουσα [of which I myself heard] καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοθέν ποθεν ἐμοὶ ἀπαγγέλλουσιν [and for those reporting to me from anywhere else]. ὡς δ’ ἂν ἐδόκουν ἐμοὶ ἕκαστοι [But as they seemed to me each] περὶ τῶν αἰεὶ παρόντων [concerning the things always present] τὰ δέοντα μάλιστ’ εἰπεῖν [to have said the necessary things most] ἐχομένῳ ὅτι ἐγγύτατα τῆς ξυμπάσης γνώμης τῶν ἀληθῶς λεχθέντων [keeping as close as possible to the general meaning of the things truly said] οὕτως εἴρηται [thus have they been spoken].

τὰ δ’ ἔργα τῶν πραχθέντων ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ [But the deeds of the things done in the war] οὐκ ἐκ τοῦ παρατυχόντος πυνθανόμενος ἠξίωσα γράφειν [I did not think fit to write inquiring from any chance source] οὐδ’ ὡς ἐμοὶ ἐδόκει [nor as it seemed to me], ἀλλ’ οἷς τε αὐτὸς παρῆν [but from those in which I myself was present] καὶ παρὰ τῶν ἄλλων [and from the others] ὅσον δυνατὸν ἀκριβείᾳ περὶ ἑκάστου ἐπεξελθών [having gone over each thing as accurately as possible].

ἐπιπόνως δὲ ηὑρίσκετο [And it was found with difficulty] διότι οἱ παρόντες τοῖς ἔργοις ἑκάστοις [because those present at the events each] οὐ ταὐτὰ περὶ τῶν αὐτῶν ἔλεγον [did not say the same things about the same things] ἀλλ’ ὡς ἑκατέρων τις εὐνοίας ἢ μνήμης ἔχοι [but as each had goodwill or memory regarding each of the two sides].

καὶ ἐς μὲν ἀκρόασιν ἴσως [And perhaps for hearing] τὸ μὴ μυθῶδες αὐτῶν ἀτερπέστερον φανεῖται [the non-mythical part of them will seem less pleasing]. ὅσοι δὲ βουλήσονται [But as many as will want] τῶν τε γενομένων τὸ σαφὲς σκοπεῖν [to consider the truth of what happened] καὶ τῶν μελλόντων ποτὲ αὖθις [and of the things being about to be sometime again] κατὰ τὸ ἀνθρώπινον [according to human nature] τοιούτων καὶ παραπλησίων ἔσεσθαι [to be such and similar things], ὠφέλιμα κρίνειν αὐτὰ ἀρκούντως ἕξει [to judge them useful will be sufficient]. κτῆμά τε ἐς αἰεὶ μᾶλλον [And it is composed as a possession for ever more] ἢ ἀγώνισμα ἐς τὸ παραχρῆμα ἀκούειν ξύγκειται [rather than a prize for immediate listening].

τῶν δὲ πρότερον ἔργων [But of the earlier deeds] μέγιστον ἐπράχθη τὸ Μηδικόν [the Median was performed greatest] καὶ τοῦτο ὅμως [and this nevertheless] δυοῖν ναυμαχίαιν καὶ πεζομαχίαιν [by two sea battles and land battles] ταχεῖαν τὴν κρίσιν ἔσχεν [had a swift decision]. τούτου δὲ τοῦ πολέμου [But of this war] μῆκός τε μέγα προύβη [a great length advanced] παθήματά τε ξυνηνέχθη γενέσθαι [and it happened that sufferings came to be] ἐν αὐτῷ τῇ Ἑλλάδι [in Greece itself] οἷα οὐχ ἕτερα ἐν ἴσῳ χρόνῳ [such as no others in an equal time].

οὔτε γὰρ πόλεις τοσαίδε [For neither so many cities] ληφθεῖσαι ἠρημώθησαν [having been captured were destroyed] αἱ μὲν ὑπὸ βαρβάρων [some by barbarians] αἱ δ’ ὑπὸ σφῶν αὐτῶν ἀντιπολεμούντων [others by themselves warring against each other] (εἰσὶ δ’ αἳ καὶ οἰκήτορας μετέβαλον ἁλισκόμεναι [and there are some which also changed inhabitants being captured]) οὔτε φυγαὶ τοσαίδε ἀνθρώπων καὶ φόνος [nor so many exiles of men and slaughter] ὁ μὲν κατ’ αὐτὸν τὸν πόλεμον [some during the war itself] ὁ δὲ διὰ τὸ στασιάζειν [others because of faction].

τά τε πρότερον ἀκοῇ μὲν λεγόμενα [And the things previously said by report] ἔργῳ δὲ σπανιώτερον βεβαιούμενα [but more rarely confirmed by deed] οὐκ ἄπιστα κατέστη [did not become disbelieved]. σεισμῶν τε πέρι [both concerning earthquakes] οἳ ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἅμα μέρος γῆς [which at one and the same time over most of the land] καὶ ἰσχυρότατοι οἱ αὐτοὶ ἐπέσχον [and the same ones being most powerful prevailed] ἡλίου τε ἐκλείψεις [and eclipses of the sun] αἳ πυκνότεραι [which more frequent] παρὰ τὰ ἐκ τοῦ πρὶν χρόνου μνημονευόμενα ξυνέβησαν [than recorded from previous time happened]. αὐχμοί τε ἔστι παρ’ οἷς μεγάλοι [And great droughts for some] καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν καὶ λιμοὶ [and from them also famines] καὶ ἡ οὐχ ἥκιστα βλάψασα [and what harmed not least] καὶ μέρος τι φθείρασα ἡ λοιμώδης νόσος [and having destroyed a certain part, the plague]. ταῦτα γὰρ πάντα [for all these things] μετὰ τοῦδε τοῦ πολέμου ἅμα ξυνεπέθετο [at the same time attacked together with this war].

ἤρξαντο δὲ αὐτοῦ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ Πελοποννήσιοι [And the Athenians and Peloponnesians began it] λύσαντες τὰς τριακοντούτεις σπονδάς [having broken the thirty-year truce] αἳ αὐτοῖς ἐγένοντο μετ’ Εὐβοίας ἅλωσιν [which they had made after the capture of Euboea].

διότι δ’ ἔλυσαν τὰς αἰτίας προύγραψα πρῶτον [And why they broke it, I wrote beforehand the causes first] καὶ τὰς διαφοράς [and the disagreements] τοῦ μή τινα ζητῆσαί ποτε [so that no one might seek ever] ἐξ ὅτου τοσοῦτος πόλεμος τοῖς Ἕλλησι κατέστη [for what reason so great a war came about for the Hellenes].

τὴν μὲν γὰρ ἀληθεστάτην πρόφασιν ἀφανεστάτην δὲ λόγῳ [For the truest reason, but most obscure in speech] τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἡγοῦμαι [I consider the Athenians] μεγάλους γιγνομένους καὶ φόβον παρέχοντας τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις [becoming great and providing fear to the Lacedaemonians] ἀναγκάσαι ἐς τὸ πολεμεῖν [to have compelled them to war]. αἱ δ’ ἐς τὸ φανερὸν λεγόμεναι αἰτίαι αἵδ’ ἦσαν ἑκατέρων [But the causes spoken of openly were these on each side] ἀφ’ ὧν λύσαντες τὰς σπονδὰς [from which having broken the truces] ἐς τὸν πόλεμον κατέστησαν [they entered into war].

Ἐπίδαμνός ἐστι πόλις [Epidamnus is a city] ἐν δεξιᾷ ἐσπλέοντι [on the right as one sails into] ἐς τὸν Ἰόνιον κόλπον [the Ionian gulf]. προσοικοῦσι δ’ αὐτὴν Ταυλάντιοι βάρβαροι [And Taulantians, barbarians, live near it] Ἰλλυρικὸν ἔθνος [an Illyrian tribe].

ταύτην ἀπῴκισαν μὲν Κερκυραῖοι [The Corcyraeans colonized this city] οἰκιστὴς δ’ ἐγένετο [and the founder was] Φαλίος Ἐρατοκλείδου Κορίνθιος [Phalios, son of Eratocleides, a Corinthian] γένος τῶν ἀφ’ Ἡρακλέους [of the lineage of Heracles] κατὰ δὴ τὸν παλαιὸν νόμον ἐκ τῆς μητροπόλεως κατακληθείς [being summoned according to the ancient custom from the mother city]. ξυνῴκισαν δὲ καὶ Κορινθίων τινὲς [And some Corinthians also joined in colonizing it] καὶ τοῦ ἄλλου Δωρικοῦ γένους [and of the other Dorian race].

προελθόντος δὲ τοῦ χρόνου [And as time advanced] ἐγένετο ἡ τῶν Ἐπιδαμνίων δύναμις μεγάλη καὶ πολυάνθρωπος [the power of the Epidamnians became great and populous].

στασιάσαντες δὲ ἐν ἀλλήλοις ἔτη πολλά [And having been in faction among themselves for many years] ὡς λέγεται [as is said] ἀπὸ πολέμου τινὸς τῶν προσοίκων βαρβάρων ἐφθάρησαν [they were destroyed from some war with the neighboring barbarians] καὶ τῆς δυνάμεως τῆς πολλῆς ἐστερήθησαν [and were deprived of their great power].

τὰ δὲ τελευταῖα [But in the last events] πρὸ τοῦδε τοῦ πολέμου [before this war] ὁ δῆμος αὐτῶν ἐξεδίωξε τοὺς δυνατούς [their populace expelled the powerful] οἱ δὲ ἐπελθόντες μετὰ τῶν βαρβάρων [and they, having attacked with the barbarians] ἐλῄζοντο τοὺς ἐν τῇ πόλει [were plundering those in the city] κατά τε γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλασσαν [both by land and by sea].

οἱ δὲ ἐν τῇ πόλει ὄντες Ἐπιδάμνιοι [And the Epidamnians being in the city] ἐπειδὴ ἐπιέζοντο [when they were being hard-pressed] πέμπουσιν ἐς τὴν Κέρκυραν πρέσβεις [they send ambassadors to Corcyra] ὡς μητρόπολιν οὖσαν [as being the mother-city] δεόμενοι μὴ σφᾶς περιορᾶν φθειρομένους [asking them not to overlook them being destroyed] ἀλλὰ τούς τε φεύγοντας ξυναλλάξαι σφίσι [but to reconcile the exiles to them] καὶ τὸν τῶν βαρβάρων πόλεμον καταλῦσαι [and to put an end to the war with the barbarians].

ταῦτα δὲ ἱκέται καθεζόμενοι ἐς τὸ Ἥραιον ἐδέοντο [And these things they asked, sitting as suppliants in the temple of Hera]. οἱ δὲ Κερκυραῖοι τὴν ἱκετείαν οὐκ ἐδέξαντο [But the Corcyraeans did not receive their supplication] ἀλλ’ ἀπράκτους ἀπέπεμψαν [but sent them away unsuccessful].

γνόντες δὲ οἱ Ἐπιδάμνιοι [And the Epidamnians, having realized] οὐδεμίαν σφίσιν ἀπὸ Κερκύρας τιμωρίαν οὖσαν [that there was no help for them from Corcyra] ἐν ἀπόρῳ εἴχοντο [were at a loss] θέσθαι τὸ παρόν [how to manage the present situation] καὶ πέμψαντες ἐς Δελφοὺς [and having sent to Delphi] τὸν θεὸν ἐπήροντο [they asked the god] εἰ παραδοῖεν Κορινθίοις τὴν πόλιν ὡς οἰκισταῖς [whether they should hand over the city to the Corinthians as founders] καὶ τιμωρίαν τινὰ πειρῷντ’ ἀπ αὐτῶν ποιεῖσθαι [and try to get some help from them]. ὁ δ’ αὐτοῖς ἀνεῖλε παραδοῦναι καὶ ἡγεμόνας ποιεῖσθαι [And he responded to them to hand it over and make them leaders].

ἐλθόντες δὲ οἱ Ἐπιδάμνιοι ἐς τὴν Κόρινθον [And the Epidamnians, having come to Corinth] κατὰ τὸ μαντεῖον [according to the oracle] παρέδοσαν τὴν ἀποικίαν [handed over the colony] τόν τε οἰκιστὴν ἀποδεικνύντες σφῶν ἐκ Κορίνθου ὄντα [pointing out that their founder was from Corinth] καὶ τὸ χρηστήριον δηλοῦντες [and making known the oracle] ἐδέοντό τε μὴ σφᾶς περιορᾶν φθειρομένους ἀλλ’ ἐπαμῦναι [and they asked them not to overlook them being destroyed, but to help].

Κορίνθιοι δὲ [And the Corinthians] κατά τε τὸ δίκαιον ὑπεδέξαντο τὴν τιμωρίαν [accepted the request for aid according to justice] νομίζοντες οὐχ ἧσσον ἑαυτῶν εἶναι τὴν ἀποικίαν ἢ Κερκυραίων [thinking the colony to be no less theirs than the Corcyraeans’] ἅμα δὲ καὶ μίσει τῶν Κερκυραίων [and at the same time also with hatred of the Corcyraeans] ὅτι αὐτῶν παρημέλουν ὄντες ἄποικοι [because, being colonists, they were neglecting them].

οὔτε γὰρ ἐν πανηγύρεσι ταῖς κοιναῖς [For neither in the common festivals] διδόντες γέρα τὰ νομιζόμενα [giving the customary honors] οὔτε Κορινθίῳ ἀνδρὶ προκαταρχόμενοι τῶν ἱερῶν [nor having a Corinthian man begin the sacrifices] ὥσπερ αἱ ἄλλαι ἀποικίαι [as the other colonies do] περιφρονοῦντες δὲ αὐτοὺς [but despising them] καὶ χρημάτων δυνάμει ὄντες [and being powerful in wealth] κατ’ ἐκεῖνον τὸν χρόνον [at that time] ὁμοῖα τοῖς Ἑλλήνων πλουσιωτάτοις [similarly to the wealthiest of the Greeks] καὶ τῇ ἐς πόλεμον παρασκευῇ δυνατώτεροι [and stronger in preparation for war] ναυτικῷ δὲ καὶ πολὺ προύχειν ἔστιν ὅτε ἐπαιρόμενοι [and at times being lifted up, also excelling much in a navy] καὶ κατὰ τὴν Φαιάκων προενοίκησιν τῆς Κερκύρας κλέος ἐχόντων τὰ περὶ τὰς ναῦς [and according to the previous dwelling of the Phaeacians of Corcyra having fame for naval matters] (ᾗ καὶ μᾶλλον ἐξηρτύοντο τὸ ναυτικὸν καὶ ἦσαν οὐκ ἀδύνατοι [whereby also they more greatly equipped their navy and were not weak]· τριήρεις γὰρ [for triremes] εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατὸν ὑπῆρχον αὐτοῖς [one hundred and twenty belonged to them] ὅτε ἤρχοντο πολεμεῖν [when they began to make war]).

πάντων οὖν τούτων ἐγκλήματα ἔχοντες οἱ Κορίνθιοι [The Corinthians, therefore, having complaints about all these things] ἔπεμπον ἐς τὴν Ἐπίδαμνον [sent to Epidamnus] ἄσμενοι τὴν ὠφελίαν [gladly the aid] οἰκήτορά τε τὸν βουλόμενον ἰέναι κελεύοντες [ordering anyone who wanted to go as a settler] καὶ Ἀμπρακιωτῶν καὶ Λευκαδίων καὶ ἑαυτῶν φρουρούς [and guards of Ambraciots and Leucadians and of themselves].

ἐπορεύθησαν δὲ πεζῇ ἐς Ἀπολλωνίαν [And they marched by land to Apollonia] Κορινθίων οὖσαν ἀποικίαν [being a colony of the Corinthians] δέει τῶν Κερκυραίων [from fear of the Corcyraeans] μὴ κωλύωνται ὑπ’ αὐτῶν [lest they be hindered by them] κατὰ θάλασσαν περαιούμενοι [crossing by sea].

Κερκυραῖοι δὲ [But the Corcyraeans] ἐπειδὴ ᾔσθοντο [when they learned] τούς τε οἰκήτορας καὶ φρουροὺς ἥκοντας ἐς τὴν Ἐπίδαμνον [that both settlers and guards had come to Epidamnus] τήν τε ἀποικίαν Κορινθίοις δεδομένην [and that the colony had been given to the Corinthians] ἐχαλέπαινον [were angry]. καὶ πλεύσαντες εὐθὺς [And having sailed immediately] πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι ναυσὶ [with twenty-five ships] καὶ ὕστερον ἑτέρῳ στόλῳ [and later with another fleet] τούς τε φεύγοντας ἐκέλευον [they ordered the exiles] κατ’ ἐπήρειαν [spitefully] δέχεσθαι αὐτούς [to receive them] (ἦλθον γὰρ ἐς τὴν Κέρκυραν οἱ τῶν Ἐπιδαμνίων φυγάδες [for the Epidamnian exiles came to Corcyra] τάφους τε ἀποδεικνύντες καὶ ξυγγένειαν [showing both tombs and kinship] ἣν προϊσχόμενοι ἐδέοντο σφᾶς κατάγειν [which putting forward they asked them to restore them]) τούς τε φρουροὺς οὓς Κορίνθιοι ἔπεμψαν [and the guards whom the Corinthians sent] καὶ τοὺς οἰκήτορας ἀποπέμπειν [and the settlers to send away].

οἱ δὲ Ἐπιδάμνιοι οὐδὲν αὐτῶν ὑπήκουσαν [But the Epidamnians obeyed none of these things]. ἀλλὰ στρατεύουσιν ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς οἱ Κερκυραῖοι [But the Corcyraeans make an expedition against them] τεσσαράκοντα ναυσὶ [with forty ships] μετὰ τῶν φυγάδων [together with the exiles] ὡς κατάξοντες [as intending to bring them back] καὶ τοὺς Ἰλλυριοὺς προσλαβόντες [and having taken along the Illyrians].

προσκαθεζόμενοι δὲ τὴν πόλιν [And having besieged the city] προεῖπον [they proclaimed] Ἐπιδαμνίων τε τὸν βουλόμενον καὶ τοὺς ξένους ἀπαθεῖς ἀπιέναι [both any Epidamnian who wished and the foreigners to depart unharmed]. εἰ δὲ μή [but if not] ὡς πολεμίοις χρήσεσθαι [they would treat them as enemies]. ὡς δ’ οὐκ ἐπείθοντο [But as they were not being persuaded] οἱ μὲν Κερκυραῖοι (ἔστι δ’ ἰσθμὸς τὸ χωρίον) ἐπολιόρκουν τὴν πόλιν [the Corcyraeans (the place is an isthmus) besieged the city].

Κορίνθιοι δὲ [But the Corinthians], ὡς αὐτοῖς ἐκ τῆς Ἐπιδάμνου ἦλθον οἱ πρέσβεις [when ambassadors came to them from Epidamnus] ἀγγέλλοντες ὅτι πολιορκοῦνται [announcing that they were being besieged], παρεσκευάζοντο στρατιάν [prepared an army] καὶ ἅμα [and at the same time] ἀποικίαν ἐξέπεμπον ἐς τὴν Ἐπίδαμνον [they sent out a colony to Epidamnus]. προείπον δὲ [and they proclaimed] τὸν βουλόμενον ἰέναι ἐπὶ ἴσοις καὶ ὁμοίοις [that whoever wished should go on fair and equal terms]. ἢν δέ τις [but if anyone] μὴ βούληται πλεῖν ἤδη [did not want to sail immediately] μετέχειν δὲ βούληται τῆς ἀποικίας [but wanted to participate in the colony], ἔχειν τὸ μέρος [he should have his share] καταθέντα χρήματα [having deposited money]. παρεῖχον δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ [And they themselves also provided] ναῦς καὶ ἄρχοντας [ships and leaders] τοῖς πλέουσιν [for those sailing].

εἰ δέ τις [But if anyone] καὶ τοῖς χρήμασι μὴ ἐθελήσει ἀκολουθεῖν [were also unwilling to accompany with money] αὐτὸς [himself] δὲ βούλοιτο [but wanted] μετέχειν [to take part] ἑξῆς τε καὶ ὁμοίως [in turn and equally] τούτοις [with these]. ὡς δὲ [And when] καὶ οὕτως οὐκ ὀλίγοι ἐπείθοντο [not a few were persuaded even in this way] καὶ χρήματα ἱκανὰ ξυνελέγετο [and sufficient money was collected], οἱ μὲν Κορίνθιοι [the Corinthians] ναῦς τε ἐπλήρουν [manned ships] καὶ τοὺς αὑτῶν ξυμμάχους ἐπηγείροντο [and summoned their allies].

Κερκυραῖοι δὲ [But the Corcyraeans] πυθόμενοι τὴν παρασκευὴν [having learned about the preparation] ἦλθον παρὰ τοὺς Κορινθίους [came to the Corinthians] πρεσβείᾳ [with an embassy] καὶ τοῖς ξυμμάχοις [and to the allies] κελεύοντες [ordering] ἀποχωρεῖν ἐκ τῆς Ἐπιδάμνου [to withdraw from Epidamnus]. ὡς οὐδὲν προσῆκον [on the grounds that they had no claim] πράσσοντες [they were acting] ἐκεῖ [there]. ὡς δὲ οὐκ ἐπείθοντο [But as they were not persuading them] ἀλλὰ καὶ [but also] ἐπὶ Κέρκυραν [against Corcyra] ἔμελλον [they were about] πλεύσεσθαι [to sail] ἢν μὴ ἀπολίπωσι τὴν Ἐπίδαμνον [if they did not leave Epidamnus],

οἱ Κερκυραῖοι [the Corcyraeans] ναυμαχίᾳ νικήσαντες [having conquered in a sea-battle] τοὺς Κορινθίους [the Corinthians] καὶ τῶν νεῶν πολλὰς λαβόντες [and having taken many of their ships] ἀνεχώρησαν [returned]. καὶ αὖθις [And again] μετὰ ταῦτα οἱ Κορίνθιοι [after these things the Corinthians] παρεσκευάζοντο [prepared themselves] ὡς στρατεύσοντες [intending to campaign] ἐπὶ τὴν Κέρκυραν [against Corcyra]. οἱ δὲ Κερκυραῖοι [And the Corcyraeans] δείσαντες τὸ μέλλον [fearing what was coming] ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς [it seemed best to them] Ἀθηναίους ποιεῖσθαι ξυμμάχους [to make the Athenians allies]. καὶ ἔπεμψαν πρέσβεις ἐς τὰς Ἀθήνας [And they sent ambassadors to Athens] δεησομένους βοηθῆσαι [to ask for aid]. οἱ δὲ Κορίνθιοι [And the Corinthians] πυθόμενοι ταῦτα [having learned these things] καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔπεμψαν πρεσβείαν [themselves also sent an embassy] ὅπως μὴ ξυμμαχήσωσιν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τοῖς Κερκυραίοις [so that the Athenians would not ally with the Corcyraeans].

γενομένης δὲ ἐκκλησίας [And with an assembly having taken place] ἐν ταῖς Ἀθήναις [in Athens] ἀνέβησαν ἐπὶ τὸ βῆμα [they ascended to the platform] οἵ τε Κερκυραίων πρέσβεις [both the ambassadors of the Corcyraeans] καὶ οἱ Κορινθίων [and of the Corinthians] καὶ ἐποιοῦντο τοὺς λόγους [and gave their speeches]. οἱ μὲν Κερκυραῖοι [The Corcyraeans] ἠξίουν [requested] δέξασθαι τὴν ξυμμαχίαν [to accept the alliance] λέγοντες [saying] ὡς μεγάλη ὠφελία [that a great benefit] τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις [for the Athenians] ἔσται [would be] ναυτικὸν [a navy] τοσοῦτον [so great] προσλαβεῖν [to acquire in addition]. οἱ δὲ Κορίνθιοι [And the Corinthians] ἀντέλεγον [argued against it] ὡς ἄδικον εἴη [that it would be unjust] τοὺς σφετέρους ἀποίκους [their colonists] δέχεσθαι [to receive] τοὺς Ἀθηναίους [the Athenians]. καὶ ἅμα [And at the same time] ἐμνήσθησαν [they reminded] τῆς προτέρας εὐεργεσίας [the previous good deed] ἣν αὐτοὶ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις παρέσχον [which they themselves had done for the Athenians].

Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ [But the Athenians] ἀκούσαντες ἀμφοτέρων [having heard both sides] ἐψηφίσαντο [voted] ξυμμαχίαν μὲν μὴ ποιήσασθαι [not to make an alliance] ἐπιμαχίαν δὲ [but a defensive alliance] τοῖς Κερκυραίοις [with the Corcyraeans] ὥστε ἀμύνειν [so as to defend] αὐτοῖς [them] ἐάν τις ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ἴῃ [if anyone should attack them]. καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα [And after this] ἀπέστειλαν ναῦς δέκα ἐς τὴν Κέρκυραν [they sent ten ships to Corcyra] βοηθούς [as aid].

οἱ δὲ Κορίνθιοι [But the Corinthians] ὀργῇ φέροντες [bearing angrily] τὴν τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐπιμαχίαν [the Athenians’ defensive alliance] πρὸς Κερκυραίους [with the Corcyraeans] παρεσκευάζοντο [prepared] νεῶν στόλον [a fleet of ships] πολὺν [large] καὶ στρατιὰν [and an army] καὶ ἔπλευσαν ἐπὶ τὴν Κέρκυραν [and sailed against Corcyra] ναυμαχήσοντες [to fight a sea battle]. οἱ δὲ Κερκυραῖοι [And the Corcyraeans] μετὰ τῶν Ἀττικῶν νεῶν [together with the Attic ships] ἀντεπέπλευσαν [sailed out against them] καὶ ναυμαχία ἐγένετο [and a sea battle took place]. καὶ ἐνίκησαν οἱ Κερκυραῖοι [And the Corcyraeans were victorious].

μετὰ δὲ τὴν ναυμαχίαν [And after the sea battle] οἱ Κορίνθιοι [the Corinthians] Ἀνακτόριον εἷλον [captured Anactorium] ὅ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῷ στόματι τοῦ Ἀμπρακικοῦ κόλπου [which is at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf] καὶ καταστήσαντες ἐν αὐτῷ Κορινθίους οἰκήτορας [and having established Corinthian settlers in it] ἀνεχώρησαν ἐπ’ οἴκου [they withdrew homeward].

αἰτία δὲ αὕτη πρώτη ἐγένετο τοῦ πολέμου [And this became the first cause of the war] τοῖς Κορινθίοις ἐς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους [for the Corinthians against the Athenians] ὅτι σφίσιν ἐν σπονδαῖς μετὰ Κερκυραίων ἐναυμάχουν [because they fought a naval battle against them while being in truce with the Corcyraeans].

μετὰ ταῦτα δ’ εὐθὺς [And immediately after these things] καὶ τάδε ξυνέβη γενέσθαι [these things also happened to occur] τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Πελοποννησίοις διάφορα [different things for the Athenians and Peloponnesians] ἐς τὸ πολεμεῖν [towards war].

τῶν γὰρ Κορινθίων πρασσόντων [For with the Corinthians intriguing] ὅπως τιμωρήσονται αὐτούς [how they would punish them] ὑποτοπήσαντες τὴν ἔχθραν αὐτῶν [having suspected their hostility] οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι [the Athenians] Ποτειδεάτας [the Potidaeans] οἳ οἰκοῦσιν ἐπὶ τῷ Ἰσθμῷ τῆς Παλλήνης [who live on the isthmus of Pallene] Κορινθίων ἀποίκους [colonists of the Corinthians] ἑαυτῶν δὲ ξυμμάχους φόρου ὑποτελεῖς [but allies of their own subject to tribute] ἐκέλευον [ordered them] τὸ ἐς Παλλήνην τεῖχος καθελεῖν [to destroy the wall towards Pallene] καὶ ὁμήρους δοῦναι [and to give hostages] τούς τε ἐπιδημιουργοὺς ἐκπέμπειν [and to send away the overseers] καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν μὴ δέχεσθαι [and for the future not to receive] οὓς κατὰ ἔτος ἕκαστον Κορίνθιοι ἔπεμπον [those whom the Corinthians used to send each year]. δείσαντες μὴ ἀποστῶσιν [fearing that they would revolt] ὑπό τε Περδίκκου πειθόμενοι καὶ Κορινθίων [being persuaded by both Perdiccas and the Corinthians] τούς τε ἄλλους τοὺς ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης ξυναποστήσωσι ξυμμάχους [and cause the rest of the allies near Thrace to revolt along with them].

ταῦτα δὲ περὶ τοὺς Ποτειδεάτας οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι προπαρεσκευάζοντο [The Athenians were making these preparations regarding the Potidaeans] εὐθὺς μετὰ τὴν ἐν Κερκύρᾳ ναυμαχίαν [immediately after the naval battle at Corcyra].

οἵ τε γὰρ Κορίνθιοι φανερῶς ἤδη διάφοροι ἦσαν [For the Corinthians were already openly hostile] Περδίκκας τε [and Perdiccas] ὁ Ἀλεξάνδρου [son of Alexander] Μακεδόνων βασιλεύς [king of the Macedonians] ἐπεπολέμωτο [had become hostile] ξύμμαχος πρότερον καὶ φίλος ὤν [being previously an ally and friend].

ἐπολεμώθη δὲ [And he became hostile] ὅτι Φιλίππῳ [because to Philip] τῷ ἑαυτοῦ ἀδελφῷ [his own brother] καὶ Δέρδᾳ [and to Derdas] κοινῇ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐναντιουμένοις [jointly opposing him] οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ξυμμαχίαν ἐποιήσαντο [the Athenians made an alliance].

δεδιώς τε [And being afraid] ἔπρασσεν [he was scheming] ἔς τε τὴν Λακεδαίμονα πέμπων [sending to Lacedaemon] ὅπως πόλεμος γένηται αὐτοῖς πρὸς Πελοποννησίους [that war might arise for them against the Peloponnesians] καὶ τοὺς Κορινθίους προσεποιεῖτο [and he tried to win over the Corinthians] τῆς Ποτειδαίας ἕνεκα ἀποστάσεως [for the sake of the revolt of Potidaea].

προσέφερε δὲ λόγους καὶ [And he made proposals also] τοῖς ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης Χαλκιδεῦσι καὶ Βοττιαίοις [to the Chalcidians and Bottiaeans in Thrace] ξυναποστῆναι [to revolt together] νομίζων [thinking] εἰ ξύμμαχα ταῦτα ἔχοι ὅμορα ὄντα τὰ χωρία [if he might have these as allies, the places being neighboring] ῥᾷον ἂν τὸν πόλεμον μετ’ αὐτῶν ποιεῖσθαι [he would more easily wage war with them].

ὧν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι αἰσθόμενοι [Which things the Athenians having perceived] καὶ βουλόμενοι προκαταλαμβάνειν τῶν πόλεων τὰς ἀποστάσεις [and wanting to anticipate the revolts of the cities] (ἔτυχον γὰρ [for they happened] τριάκοντα ναῦς ἀποστέλλοντες [to be sending thirty ships] καὶ χιλίους ὁπλίτας [and a thousand hoplites] ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ [against his land] Ἀρχεστράτου [with Archestratus] τοῦ Λυκομήδους [son of Lycomedes] μετ’ ἄλλων δέκα στρατηγοῦντος [leading them with ten others as generals]) ἐπιστέλλουσι τοῖς ἄρχουσι τῶν νεῶν [they order the commanders of the ships] Ποτειδεατῶν τε ὁμήρους λαβεῖν [both to take hostages of the Potidaeans] καὶ τὸ τεῖχος καθελεῖν [and to destroy the wall] τῶν τε πλησίον πόλεων φυλακὴν ἔχειν [and to keep guard of the neighboring cities] ὅπως μὴ ἀποστήσονται [so that they would not revolt].

Ποτειδεᾶται δὲ [And the Potidaeans] πέμψαντες μὲν καὶ παρ’ Ἀθηναίους πρέσβεις [having sent also ambassadors to the Athenians] εἴ πως πείσειαν μὴ σφῶν πέρι νεωτερίζειν μηδέν [if somehow they might persuade them not to undertake any new measures regarding them] ἐλθόντες δὲ καὶ ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα μετὰ Κορινθίων [and having also come to Lacedaemon with Corinthians] ὅπως ἑτοιμάσαιντο τιμωρίαν ἢν δέῃ [that they should prepare help if there were need] ἐπειδὴ [when] ἔκ τε Ἀθηνῶν ἐκ πολλοῦ πράσσοντες οὐδὲν ηὕροντο ἐπιτήδειον [both from Athens negotiating for a long time they found nothing suitable] ἀλλ’ αἱ νῆες αἱ ἐπὶ Μακεδονίαν καὶ ἐπὶ σφᾶς ὁμοίως ἔπλεον [but the ships were sailing similarly against Macedonia and against them] καὶ τὰ τέλη τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ὑπέσχετο αὐτοῖς [and the magistrates of the Lacedaemonians promised them] ἢν ἐπὶ Ποτείδαιαν ἴωσιν Ἀθηναῖοι [if the Athenians should attack Potidaea] ἐς τὴν Ἀττικὴν ἐσβαλεῖν [to invade Attica] τότε δὴ [then indeed] κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον [at this opportune moment] ἀφίστανται [they revolt] μετὰ Χαλκιδέων καὶ Βοττιαίων [along with the Chalcidians and Bottiaeans] κοινῇ ξυνομόσαντες [having sworn an oath together].

καὶ Περδίκκας πείθει Χαλκιδέας [And Perdiccas persuades the Chalcidians] τὰς ἐπὶ θαλάσσῃ πόλεις ἐκλιπόντας καὶ καταβαλόντας [to abandon and raze the cities by the sea] ἀνοικίσασθαι ἐς Ὄλυνθον [and to settle inland at Olynthus] μίαν τε πόλιν ταύτην ἰσχυρὰν ποιήσασθαι [and to make this one city strong]. τοῖς τ’ ἐκλιποῦσι τούτοις [And to these abandoning their cities] τῆς ἑαυτοῦ γῆς τῆς Μυγδονίας [of his own Mygdonian land] περὶ τὴν Βόλβην λίμνην ἔδωκε νέμεσθαι [around Lake Bolbe he gave to inhabit] ἕως ἂν ὁ πρὸς Ἀθηναίους πόλεμος ᾖ [until the war against the Athenians should be]. καὶ οἱ μὲν ἀνῳκίζοντό τε καθαιροῦντες τὰς πόλεις καὶ ἐς πόλεμον παρεσκευάζοντο [And they were both resettling, destroying the cities, and preparing for war].

αἱ δὲ τριάκοντα νῆες τῶν Ἀθηναίων [But the thirty ships of the Athenians] ἀφικνοῦνται ἐς τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης [arrive at the region of Thrace] καὶ καταλαμβάνουσι [and find] τήν τε Ποτείδαιαν καὶ τἆλλα ἀφεστηκότα [both Potidaea and the other places having revolted].

νομίσαντες δὲ οἱ στρατηγοὶ [And the generals thinking] ἀδύνατα εἶναι [it to be impossible] πρός τε Περδίκκαν πολεμεῖν [both to war against Perdiccas] τῇ παρούσῃ δυνάμει [with the present force] καὶ τὰ ξυναφεστῶτα χωρία [and the places having revolted together] τρέπονται ἐπὶ τὴν Μακεδονίαν [they turn towards Macedonia] ἐφ’ ὅπερ καὶ τὸ πρῶτον ἐξεπέμποντο [for which also they were sent out at first] καὶ καταστάντες ἐπολέμουν [and having taken position they warred] μετὰ Φιλίππου [together with Philip] καὶ τῶν Δέρδου ἀδελφῶν [and the brothers of Derdas] ἄνωθεν στρατιᾷ ἐσβεβληκότων [having invaded from above with an army].

καὶ ἐν τούτῳ οἱ Κορίνθιοι [And at this time the Corinthians], τῆς Ποτειδαίας ἀφεστηκυίας [with Potidaea having revolted] καὶ τῶν Ἀττικῶν νεῶν περὶ Μακεδονίαν οὐσῶν [and the Attic ships being around Macedonia], δεδιότες περὶ τῷ χωρίῳ [being afraid for the place] καὶ οἰκεῖον τὸν κίνδυνον ἡγούμενοι [and considering the danger their own] πέμπουσιν [they sent] ἑαυτῶν τε ἐθελοντάς [both volunteers of their own] καὶ τῶν ἄλλων Πελοποννησίων μισθῷ πείσαντες [and having persuaded by pay men of the other Peloponnesians] ἑξακοσίους καὶ χιλίους τοὺς πάντας ὁπλίτας [in all sixteen hundred hoplites] καὶ ψιλοὺς τετρακοσίους [and four hundred light-armed troops].

ἐστρατήγει δὲ αὐτῶν Ἀριστεὺς [And Aristeus commanded them] ὁ Ἀδειμάντου [son of Adeimantus]. κατὰ φιλίαν τε αὐτοῦ [and because of friendship with him] οὐχ ἥκιστα οἱ πλεῖστοι ἐκ Κορίνθου στρατιῶται ἐθελονταὶ ξυνέσποντο [especially most of the soldiers from Corinth accompanied as volunteers]. ἦν γὰρ τοῖς Ποτειδεάταις αἰεί ποτε ἐπιτήδειος [For he was always well-disposed to the Potidaeans].

καὶ ἀφικνοῦνται [And they arrive] τεσσαρακοστῇ ἡμέρᾳ ὕστερον ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης [on the fortieth day later in Thrace] ἢ Ποτείδαια ἀπέστη [than Potidaea revolted].

ἦλθε δὲ καὶ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις εὐθὺς [And the news also came immediately to the Athenians] ἡ ἀγγελία τῶν πόλεων ὅτι ἀφεστᾶσι [the announcement from the cities that they had revolted] καὶ πέμπουσιν [and they sent] ὡς ᾔσθοντο καὶ τοὺς μετ’ Ἀριστέως ἐπιπαριόντας [as they perceived that those with Aristeus were also approaching] δισχιλίους ἑαυτῶν ὁπλίτας [two thousand of their own hoplites] καὶ τεσσαράκοντα ναῦς [and forty ships] πρὸς τὰ ἀφεστηκότα [against the revolted places] καὶ Καλλίαν [and Callias] τὸν Καλλιάδου [son of Calliades] πέμπτον αὐτὸν στρατηγόν [as general with four others].

οἳ ἀφικόμενοι ἐς Μακεδονίαν [Who, having arrived in Macedonia] πρῶτον καταλαμβάνουσι [first find] τοὺς προτέρους χιλίους [the former thousand men] Θέρμην ἄρτι ἑαλωκυίας [having recently taken Therme] καὶ Πύδναν πολιορκοῦντας [and besieging Pydna].

προσκαθεζόμενοι δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ τὴν Πύδναν [And they themselves also, having besieged Pydna] ἐπολιόρκησαν μέν [they did besiege it indeed] ἔπειτα δὲ ξύμβασιν ποιησάμενοι [but then, having made a treaty] καὶ ξυμμαχίαν ἀναγκαίαν πρὸς τὸν Περδίκκαν [and a necessary alliance with Perdiccas] ὡς αὐτοὺς κατήπειγεν ἡ Ποτείδαια [as Potidaea was pressing them hard] καὶ ὁ Ἀριστεὺς παρεληλυθώς [and Aristeus having arrived] ἀπανίστανται ἐκ τῆς Μακεδονίας [they depart from Macedonia].

καὶ ἀφικόμενοι ἐς Βέροιαν [And arriving at Beroea] κἀκεῖθεν ἐπὶ Στρέψαν [and from there against Strepsa] καὶ πειράσαντες πρῶτον τοῦ χωρίου καὶ οὐχ ἑλόντες [and first having attempted the place and not having taken it] ἐπορεύοντο κατὰ γῆν πρὸς τὴν Ποτείδαιαν [they marched by land towards Potidaea] τρισχιλίοις μὲν ὁπλίταις ἑαυτῶν [with three thousand of their own hoplites] χωρὶς δὲ τῶν ξυμμάχων πολλοῖς [besides many allies] ἱππεῦσι δὲ ἑξακοσίοις Μακεδόνων [and with six hundred Macedonian cavalry] τοῖς μετὰ Φιλίππου καὶ Παυσανίου [those with Philip and Pausanias]. ἅμα δὲ νῆες παρέπλεον ἑβδομήκοντα [And at the same time seventy ships sailed along the coast].

κατ’ ὀλίγον δὲ προϊόντες [And advancing little by little] τριταῖοι ἀφίκοντο ἐς Γίγωνον [on the third day they arrived at Gigonus] καὶ ἐστρατοπεδεύσαντο [and encamped].

Ποτειδεᾶται δὲ καὶ οἱ μετὰ Ἀριστέως Πελοποννήσιοι [But the Potidaeans and the Peloponnesians with Aristeus] προσδεχόμενοι τοὺς Ἀθηναίους [expecting the Athenians] ἐστρατοπεδεύοντο πρὸς Ὀλύνθου [encamped near Olynthus] ἐν τῷ Ἰσθμῷ [in the isthmus] καὶ ἀγορὰν ἔξω τῆς πόλεως ἐπεποίηντο [and had established a market outside the city].

στρατηγὸν μὲν οὖν τοῦ πεζοῦ παντός [Therefore the allies had appointed Aristeus general] οἱ ξύμμαχοι [the allies] ᾕρηντο Ἀριστέα [Aristeus] τῆς δὲ ἵππου Περδίκκαν [and Perdiccas of the cavalry]. ἀπέστη γὰρ εὐθὺς πάλιν τῶν Ἀθηναίων [For he immediately revolted again from the Athenians] καὶ ξυνεμάχει τοῖς Ποτειδεάταις [and fought alongside the Potidaeans] Ἰόλαον ἀνθ’ αὑτοῦ καταστήσας ἄρχοντα [having appointed Iolaus as commander in his place].

ἦν δὲ ἡ γνώμη τοῦ Ἀριστέως [And the plan of Aristeus was] τὸ μὲν μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ στρατόπεδον ἔχοντι [to hold his own army in the isthmus] ἐν τῷ Ἰσθμῷ ἐπιτηρεῖν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους [to watch for the Athenians if they should advance] ἢν ἐπίωσι [if they should come] Χαλκιδέας δὲ καὶ τοὺς ἔξω Ἰσθμοῦ ξυμμάχους [but the Chalcidians and the allies outside the isthmus] καὶ τὴν παρὰ Περδίκκου διακοσίαν ἵππον [and the two hundred cavalry from Perdiccas] ἐν Ὀλύνθῳ μένειν [to remain at Olynthus]. καὶ ὅταν Ἀθηναῖοι ἐπὶ σφᾶς χωρῶσι [and when the Athenians march against them] κατὰ νώτου βοηθοῦντας ἐν μέσῳ ποιεῖν αὑτῶν τοὺς πολεμίους [to attack from behind and thus surround their enemies].

Καλλίας δ’ αὖ [But Callias] ὁ τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγός [the Athenian general] καὶ οἱ ξυνάρχοντες [and his fellow commanders] τοὺς μὲν Μακεδόνας ἱππέας [the Macedonian cavalrymen] καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων ὀλίγους [and a few of the allies] ἐπὶ Ὀλύνθου ἀποπέμπουσιν [they send away to Olynthus] ὅπως εἴργωσι τοὺς ἐκεῖθεν ἐπιβοηθεῖν [so that they might prevent those from there from bringing aid] αὐτοὶ δὲ ἀναστήσαντες τὸ στρατόπεδον ἐχώρουν ἐπὶ τὴν Ποτείδαιαν [but they themselves, having broken camp, advanced against Potidaea].

καὶ ἐπειδὴ πρὸς τῷ Ἰσθμῷ ἐγένοντο [And when they arrived at the isthmus] καὶ εἶδον τοὺς ἐναντίους παρασκευαζομένους ὡς ἐς μάχην [and saw the enemy preparing for battle] ἀντικαθίσταντο καὶ αὐτοί [they too took up position opposite them] καὶ οὐ πολὺ ὕστερον ξυνέμισγον [and not much later joined battle].

καὶ αὐτὸ μὲν τὸ τοῦ Ἀριστέως κέρας [And the wing itself of Aristeus] καὶ ὅσοι περὶ ἐκεῖνον ἦσαν Κορινθίων τε καὶ τῶν ἄλλων λογάδες [and as many picked men of Corinthians and of the others as were around him] ἔτρεψαν τὸ καθ’ ἑαυτούς [routed those opposite them] καὶ ἐπεξῆλθον διώκοντες ἐπὶ πολύ [and went out pursuing them for a considerable distance]. τὸ δὲ ἄλλο στρατόπεδον [But the rest of the army] Ποτειδεατῶν καὶ Πελοποννησίων [of Potidaeans and Peloponnesians] ἡσσᾶτο ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀθηναίων [was defeated by the Athenians] καὶ ἐς τὸ τεῖχος κατέφυγεν [and fled to the wall].

ἐπαναχωρῶν δὲ ὁ Ἀριστεὺς [And Aristeus, withdrawing] ἀπὸ τῆς διώξεως [from the pursuit] ὡς ὁρᾷ τὸ ἄλλο στράτευμα ἡσσημένον [when he sees the other army defeated] ἠπόρησε μὲν [was at a loss indeed] ὁποτέρωσε διακινδυνεύσῃ χωρήσας [to which of the two places he should proceed taking a risk] ἢ ἐπὶ τῆς Ὀλύνθου ἢ ἐς τὴν Ποτείδαιαν [either towards Olynthus or to Potidaea]. ἔδοξε δ’ οὖν [It seemed best therefore] ξυναγαγόντι τοὺς μεθ’ αὑτοῦ ὡς ἐς ἐλάχιστον χωρίον [having assembled those with himself into as small a space as possible] δρόμῳ βιάσασθαι ἐς τὴν Ποτείδαιαν [to force his way at a run to Potidaea] καὶ παρῆλθε παρὰ τὴν χηλὴν [and he passed along the breakwater] διὰ τῆς θαλάσσης [through the sea] βαλλόμενός τε καὶ χαλεπῶς [being shot at and with difficulty] ὀλίγους μέν τινας ἀποβαλών [having lost some few men] τοὺς δὲ πλείους σώσας [but having saved the majority].

οἱ δ’ ἀπὸ τῆς Ὀλύνθου τοῖς Ποτειδεάταις βοηθοί [And those from Olynthus, aid for the Potidaeans] (ἀπέχει δὲ [and it is distant] ἑξήκοντα μάλιστα σταδίους [about sixty stades] καὶ ἔστι καταφανές [and is visible]) ὡς ἡ μάχη ἐγίγνετο καὶ τὰ σημεῖα ἤρθη [when the battle was taking place and the signals were raised] βραχύ μέν τι προῆλθον [advanced a short distance] ὡς βοηθήσοντες [as if about to help] καὶ οἱ Μακεδόνες ἱππῆς ἀντιπαρετάξαντο ὡς κωλύσοντες [and the Macedonian cavalry drew up opposite them as if to hinder them]. ἐπειδὴ δὲ [But when] διὰ τάχους ἡ νίκη τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἐγίγνετο [the victory of the Athenians was happening quickly] καὶ τὰ σημεῖα κατεσπάσθη [and the signals were lowered] πάλιν ἐπανεχώρουν ἐς τὸ τεῖχος [they retreated again to the wall] καὶ οἱ Μακεδόνες παρὰ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους [and the Macedonians to the Athenians]. ἱππῆς δ’ οὐδετέροις παρεγένοντο [And cavalry came to neither side].

μετὰ δὲ τὴν μάχην [And after the battle] τροπαῖον ἔστησαν οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι [the Athenians set up a trophy] καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς ὑποσπόνδους ἀπέδοσαν τοῖς Ποτειδεάταις [and gave back the dead under truce to the Potidaeans]. ἀπέθανον δὲ [And there died] Ποτειδεατῶν μὲν καὶ τῶν ξυμμάχων [of Potidaeans and their allies] ὀλίγῳ ἐλάσσους τριακοσίων [a little less than three hundred] Ἀθηναίων δὲ αὐτῶν [but of the Athenians themselves] πεντήκοντα καὶ ἑκατόν [one hundred and fifty] καὶ Καλλίας ὁ στρατηγός [and Callias the general].

τὸ δὲ ἐκ τοῦ Ἰσθμοῦ τεῖχος εὐθὺς οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἀποτειχίσαντες ἐφρούρουν [And the Athenians, having immediately blockaded the wall from the isthmus, guarded it]. τὸ δ’ ἐς τὴν Παλλήνην ἀτείχιστον ἦν [But the wall towards Pallene was unfortified]. οὐ γὰρ ἱκανοὶ ἐνόμιζον εἶναι [For they did not think themselves sufficient] ἔν τε τῷ Ἰσθμῷ φρουρεῖν [both to keep guard on the isthmus] καὶ ἐς τὴν Παλλήνην διαβάντες τειχίζειν [and having crossed over to Pallene to build a wall] δεδιότες [fearing] μὴ σφίσιν οἱ Ποτειδεᾶται καὶ οἱ ξύμμαχοι γενομένοις δίχα ἐπίθωνται [lest the Potidaeans and the allies should attack them having been divided].

καὶ πυνθανόμενοι οἱ ἐν τῇ πόλει Ἀθηναῖοι [And the Athenians in the city learning] τὴν Παλλήνην ἀτείχιστον οὖσαν [that Pallene was unfortified] χρόνῳ ὕστερον πέμπουσιν [later in time they sent] ἑξακοσίους καὶ χιλίους ὁπλίτας ἑαυτῶν [sixteen hundred hoplites of their own] καὶ Φορμίωνα [and Phormio] τὸν Ἀσωπίου στρατηγόν [son of Asopius, general]. ὃς ἀφικόμενος ἐς τὴν Παλλήνην [Who, having arrived in Pallene] καὶ ἐξ Ἀφύτιος ὁρμώμενος [and setting out from Aphytis] προσήγαγε τῇ Ποτειδαίᾳ τὸν στρατόν [led his army against Potidaea] κατὰ βραχὺ προϊών [advancing little by little] καὶ κείρων ἅμα τὴν γῆν [and at the same time ravaging the land]. ὡς δὲ οὐδεὶς ἐπεξῄει ἐς μάχην [But since no one came out against him for battle] ἀπετείχισε τὸ ἐκ τῆς Παλλήνης τεῖχος [he built a wall across from Pallene].

καὶ οὕτως ἤδη [And thus already] κατὰ κράτος ἡ Ποτείδαια ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἐπολιορκεῖτο [Potidaea on both sides was being besieged by land] καὶ ἐκ θαλάσσης ναυσὶν ἅμα ἐφορμούσαις [and also from the sea by blockading ships].

Ἀριστεὺς δὲ [And Aristeus] ἀποτειχισθείσης αὐτῆς [with it having been walled off] καὶ ἐλπίδα οὐδεμίαν ἔχων σωτηρίας [and having no hope of safety] ἢν μή τι ἀπὸ Πελοποννήσου ἢ ἄλλο παρὰ λόγον γίγνηται [unless something should happen from the Peloponnese or otherwise contrary to expectation] ξυνεβούλευε μὲν [advised indeed] πλὴν πεντακοσίων [except five hundred] ἄνεμον τηρήσασι τοῖς ἄλλοις ἐκπλεῦσαι [for the rest, having waited for a wind, to sail out] ὅπως ἐπὶ πλέον ὁ σῖτος ἀντίσχῃ [so that their grain might hold out longer] καὶ αὐτὸς ἤθελε τῶν μενόντων εἶναι [and he himself was willing to be among those remaining]. ὡς δ’ οὐκ ἔπειθε [But as he was not persuading them] βουλόμενος τὰ ἐπὶ τούτοις παρασκευάζειν [wanting to make preparations after these things] καὶ ὅπως τὰ ἔξωθεν ἕξει ὡς ἄριστα [and how the outside things might proceed as well as possible] ἔκπλουν ποιεῖται [he makes a sortie] λαθὼν τὴν φυλακὴν τῶν Ἀθηναίων [having escaped the notice of the Athenian guards].

καὶ παραμένων ἐν Χαλκιδεῦσι [And remaining among the Chalcidians] τά τε ἄλλα ξυνεπολέμει [he took part in the rest of the war] καὶ Σερμυλιῶν λοχήσας πρὸς τῇ πόλει πολλοὺς διέφθειρεν [and having laid an ambush for the Sermylians near the city he killed many] ἔς τε τὴν Πελοπόννησον ἔπρασσεν [and he was scheming with the Peloponnese] ὅπῃ ὠφελία τις γενήσεται [how some help might arise]. μετὰ δὲ τῆς Ποτειδαίας τὴν ἀποτείχισιν [And after the blockade of Potidaea] Φορμίων μὲν [Phormio] ἔχων τοὺς ἑξακοσίους καὶ χιλίους [having the sixteen hundred] τὴν Χαλκιδικὴν καὶ Βοττικὴν ἐδῄου [ravaged Chalcidice and Bottice] καὶ ἔστιν ἃ καὶ πολίσματα εἷλεν [and captured some small towns as well].

μετὰ δὲ τῆς Ποτειδαίας τὴν ἀποτείχισιν [And after the blockade of Potidaea] Φορμίων μὲν [Phormio] ἔχων τοὺς ἑξακοσίους καὶ χιλίους [having the sixteen hundred] τὴν Χαλκιδικὴν καὶ Βοττικὴν ἐδῄου [ravaged Chalcidice and Bottice] καὶ ἔστιν ἃ καὶ πολίσματα εἷλεν [and captured some small towns as well].

τοῖς δ’ Ἀθηναίοις καὶ Πελοποννησίοις [And for the Athenians and Peloponnesians] αἰτίαι μὲν αὗται προυγεγένηντο ἐς ἀλλήλους [these causes had previously arisen against each other] τοῖς μὲν Κορινθίοις [for the Corinthians] ὅτι τὴν Ποτείδαιαν ἑαυτῶν οὖσαν ἀποικίαν [because Potidaea, being a colony of their own] καὶ ἄνδρας Κορινθίων τε καὶ Πελοποννησίων ἐν αὐτῇ ὄντας ἐπολιόρκουν [and men of Corinthians and Peloponnesians being in it, they were besieging] τοῖς δὲ Ἀθηναίοις ἐς τοὺς Πελοποννησίους [and for the Athenians against the Peloponnesians] ὅτι ἑαυτῶν τε πόλιν ξυμμαχίδα καὶ φόρου ὑποτελῆ [because a city allied with themselves and subject to tribute] ἀπέστησαν [revolted] καὶ ἐλθόντες σφίσιν ἀπὸ τοῦ προφανοῦς ἐμάχοντο μετὰ Ποτειδεατῶν [and coming openly they fought against them with the Potidaeans]. οὐ μέντοι ὅ γε πόλεμός πω ξυνερρώγει [However, the war had not yet broken out] ἀλλ’ ἔτι ἀνοκωχὴ ἦν [but there was still a truce]. ἰδίᾳ γὰρ ταῦτα οἱ Κορίνθιοι ἔπραξαν [For the Corinthians did these things privately].

πολιορκουμένης δὲ τῆς Ποτειδαίας [With Potidaea being besieged] οὐχ ἡσύχαζον [they were not quiet] ἀνδρῶν τε σφίσιν ἐνόντων [both men of theirs being inside] καὶ ἅμα περὶ τῷ χωρίῳ δεδιότες [and at the same time fearing for the place]. παρεκάλουν τε εὐθὺς ἐς τὴν Λακεδαίμονα τοὺς ξυμμάχους [And they immediately summoned the allies to Lacedaemon] καὶ κατεβόων ἐλθόντες τῶν Ἀθηναίων [and having come they denounced the Athenians] ὅτι σπονδάς τε λελυκότες εἶεν καὶ ἀδικοῖεν τὴν Πελοπόννησον [that they had broken the truce and were wronging the Peloponnese].

Αἰγινῆταί τε [And the Aeginetans] φανερῶς μὲν οὐ πρεσβευόμενοι [openly indeed not sending an embassy] δεδιότες τοὺς Ἀθηναίους [fearing the Athenians] κρύφα δὲ οὐχ ἥκιστα μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐνῆγον τὸν πόλεμον [but secretly not least incited the war along with them] λέγοντες οὐκ εἶναι αὐτόνομοι κατὰ τὰς σπονδάς [saying that they were not autonomous according to the treaty].

οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι [And the Lacedaemonians] προσπαρακαλέσαντες τῶν ξυμμάχων [having further summoned the allies] τε καὶ εἴ τίς τι ἄλλο ἔφη ἠδικῆσθαι ὑπὸ Ἀθηναίων [and whoever else said they had been wronged by the Athenians] ξύλλογον σφῶν αὐτῶν ποιήσαντες τὸν εἰωθότα [having held their customary assembly] λέγειν ἐκέλευον [ordered them to speak].

καὶ ἄλλοι τε παριόντες ἐγκλήματα ἐποιοῦντο [And others coming forward made accusations] ὡς ἕκαστοι [each as they were disposed] καὶ Μεγαρῆς [and the Megarians] δηλοῦντες μὲν καὶ ἕτερα οὐκ ὀλίγα διάφορα [setting forth indeed also other not few differences] μάλιστα δὲ [but especially] λιμένων τε εἴργεσθαι τῶν ἐν τῇ Ἀθηναίων ἀρχῇ [that they were excluded from the harbors in the Athenian empire] καὶ τῆς Ἀττικῆς ἀγορᾶς [and from the Attic market] παρὰ τὰς σπονδάς [contrary to the treaty].

παρελθόντες δὲ τελευταῖοι Κορίνθιοι [And the Corinthians, having come forward last] καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἐάσαντες πρῶτον παροξῦναι τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους [and having allowed the others first to incite the Lacedaemonians] ἐπεῖπον τοιάδε [spoke as follows].

τὸ πιστὸν ὑμᾶς [Your trustworthiness], ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι [Lacedaemonians], τῆς καθ’ ὑμᾶς αὐτοὺς πολιτείας [of your own way of life] καὶ ὁμιλίας [and intercourse] ἀπιστοτέρους ἐς τοὺς ἄλλους [more distrustful toward others] ἤν τι λέγωμεν καθίστησιν [makes you, if we say anything]. καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ σωφροσύνην μὲν ἔχετε [And from this you have moderation] ἀμαθίᾳ δὲ πλέονι πρὸς τὰ ἔξω πράγματα χρῆσθε [but with more ignorance you deal with external affairs].

πολλάκις γὰρ [For often] προαγορευόντων ἡμῶν [with us foretelling] ἃ ἐμέλλομεν ὑπὸ Ἀθηναίων βλάπτεσθαι [that we were about to be harmed by the Athenians], οὐ περὶ ὧν ἐδιδάσκομεν ἑκάστοτε τὴν μάθησιν ἐποιεῖσθε [you did not each time take instruction concerning what we were teaching] ἀλλὰ τῶν λεγόντων μᾶλλον ὑπενοεῖτε [but you suspected rather those speaking] ὡς ἕνεκα τῶν αὐτοῖς ἰδίᾳ διαφόρων λέγουσιν [that they speak because of their own private quarrels]. καὶ δι’ αὐτὸ [And on account of this] οὐ πρὶν πάσχειν [not before suffering] ἀλλ’ ἐπειδὴ ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ ἐσμέν [but now that we are in the action] τοὺς ξυμμάχους τούσδε παρεκαλέσατε [you summoned these allies] ἐν οἷς προσήκει ἡμᾶς οὐχ ἥκιστα εἰπεῖν [among whom it is fitting for us not least to speak] ὅσῳ καὶ μέγιστα ἐγκλήματα ἔχομεν [inasmuch as we have the greatest complaints] ὑπὸ μὲν Ἀθηναίων ὑβριζόμενοι [on the one hand being insulted by the Athenians] ὑπὸ δὲ ὑμῶν ἀμελούμενοι [on the other being neglected by you].

καὶ εἰ μὲν ἀφανεῖς που ὄντες [And if, being somewhere unseen] ἠδίκουν τὴν Ἑλλάδα [they were harming Greece] διδασκαλίας ἂν ὡς οὐκ εἰδόσι προσέδει [there would be need of instruction, as if to those not knowing]. νῦν δὲ [But now] τί δεῖ μακρηγορεῖν [what need is there of a long speech] ὧν [concerning which things] τοὺς μὲν δεδουλωμένους ὁρᾶτε [you see some enslaved] τοῖς δὲ ἐπιβουλεύοντας αὐτούς [and themselves plotting against others] καὶ οὐχ ἥκιστα τοῖς ἡμετέροις ξυμμάχοις [and not least against our allies] καὶ ἐκ πολλοῦ προπαρεσκευασμένους [and prepared long beforehand] εἴ ποτε ἄρα πολεμήσονται [if ever they intend to wage war]? οὐ γὰρ ἂν [For they would not] Κέρκυράν τε ὑπολαβόντες [having taken Corcyra] βίᾳ ἡμῶν εἶχον [be holding it by force against us] καὶ Ποτείδαιαν ἐπολιόρκουν [and be besieging Potidaea] ὧν [of which places] τὸ μὲν ἐπικαιρότατον χωρίον [the former is a most opportune place] πρὸς τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης ἀποχρῆσθαι [for use regarding the region of Thrace] ἡ δὲ ναυτικὸν ἂν μέγιστον παρέσχε Πελοποννησίοις [and the latter would have provided a very great fleet to the Peloponnesians].

καὶ τῶνδε ὑμεῖς αἴτιοι [And of these things you are responsible] τό τε πρῶτον ἐάσαντες αὐτοὺς [both first having allowed them] τὴν πόλιν μετὰ τὰ Μηδικὰ κρατῦναι [to strengthen their city after the Persian Wars] καὶ ὕστερον τὰ μακρὰ στῆσαι τείχη [and later to build the Long Walls] ἐς τόδε τε αἰεὶ ἀποστεροῦντες [and up to this time continually depriving] οὐ μόνον τοὺς ὑπ’ ἐκείνων δεδουλωμένους ἐλευθερίας [not only those enslaved by them of freedom] ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ὑμετέρους ἤδη ξυμμάχους [but also now your allies]. οὐ γὰρ [For not] ὁ δουλωσάμενος [he who enslaved] ἀλλ’ ὁ δυνάμενος μὲν παῦσαι περιορῶν δέ [but he who being able to stop, looks on] ἀληθέστερον αὐτὸ δρᾷ [more truly does it] εἴπερ καὶ τὴν ἀξίωσιν τῆς ἀρετῆς ὡς ἐλευθερῶν τὴν Ἑλλάδα φέρεται [if indeed he bears the claim of virtue as if freeing Greece].

μόλις δὲ νῦν γε ξυνήλθομεν [But we have with difficulty now assembled] καὶ οὐδὲ νῦν ἐπὶ φανεροῖς [and not even now for evident reasons]. χρῆν γὰρ [For it was necessary] οὐκ εἰ ἀδικούμεθα ἔτι σκοπεῖν [not still to be considering if we are being wronged] ἀλλὰ καθ’ ὅτι ἀμυνούμεθα [but by what means we shall defend ourselves]. οἱ γὰρ δρῶντες βεβουλευμένοι [For those acting, having planned] πρὸς οὐ διεγνωκότας [against those not having decided] ἤδη καὶ οὐ μέλλοντες ἐπέρχονται [attack already and not intending to].

καὶ ἐπιστάμεθα [And we know] οἵᾳ ὁδῷ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι [by what path the Athenians] καὶ ὅτι κατ’ ὀλίγον χωροῦσιν ἐπὶ τοὺς πέλας [and that little by little they advance against their neighbors]. καὶ λανθάνειν μὲν οἰόμενοι [And thinking to be unnoticed] διὰ τὸ ἀναίσθητον ὑμῶν [because of your lack of perception] ἧσσον θαρσοῦσι [they are less bold] γνόντες δὲ εἰδότας περιορᾶν [but having recognized that you know and disregard] ἰσχυρῶς ἐγκείσονται [they will press on strongly]. ἡσυχάζετε γάρ [For you are remaining quiet] μόνοι Ἑλλήνων [alone of the Greeks] ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι [Lacedaemonians], οὐ τῇ δυνάμει τινά [not some by their power] ἀλλὰ τῇ μελλήσει ἀμυνόμενοι [but you, by delay, are defending yourselves] καὶ μόνοι οὐκ ἀρχομένην τὴν αὔξησιν τῶν ἐχθρῶν [and alone not the beginning of the growth of the enemies] διπλασιουμένην δὲ καταλύοντες [but when it has doubled, you stop it].

καίτοι ἐλέγεσθε ἀσφαλεῖς εἶναι [And yet you were said to be secure] ὧν ἄρα ὁ λόγος τοῦ ἔργου ἐκράτει [whose reputation therefore prevailed over their deeds]. τόν τε γὰρ Μῆδον [For both the Mede] αὐτοὶ ἴσμεν [we ourselves know] ἐκ περάτων γῆς [from the ends of the earth] πρότερον ἐπὶ τὴν Πελοπόννησον ἐλθόντα [having previously come to the Peloponnese] ἢ τὰ παρ’ ὑμῶν ἀξίως προαπαντῆσαι [than for you worthily to have gone out against him]. καὶ νῦν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους [And now the Athenians] οὐχ ἑκάς [not far off] ὥσπερ ἐκεῖνον [as that one] ἀλλ’ ἐγγὺς ὄντας περιορᾶτε [but being near you are overlooking] καὶ ἀντὶ τοῦ ἐπελθεῖν αὐτοὶ [and instead of attacking them yourselves] ἀμύνεσθαι βούλεσθε μᾶλλον ἐπιόντας [you prefer to defend yourselves against them attacking] καὶ ἐς τύχας [and to come into risky situations] πρὸς πολλῷ δυνατωτέρους ἀγωνιζόμενοι καταστῆναι [struggling against those much stronger]. ἐπιστάμενοι [knowing] καὶ τὸν βάρβαρον αὐτὸν [that even the barbarian himself] περὶ αὑτῷ τὰ πλείω σφαλέντα [was mostly mistaken about himself]. καὶ πρὸς αὐτοὺς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους [And against the Athenians themselves] πολλὰ ἡμᾶς ἤδη [often already us] τοῖς ἁμαρτήμασιν αὐτῶν [by their mistakes] μᾶλλον ἢ τῇ ἀφ’ ὑμῶν τιμωρίᾳ περιγεγενημένους [rather than by punishment from you, having survived]. ἐπεὶ αἵ γε ὑμέτεραι ἐλπίδες [since your hopes] ἤδη τινάς που καὶ ἀπαρασκεύους [already some I suppose being unprepared] διὰ τὸ πιστεῦσαι ἔφθειραν [because of trusting, have destroyed].

καὶ μηδεὶς ὑμῶν [And let no one of you] ἐπ’ ἔχθρᾳ τὸ πλέον ἢ αἰτίᾳ νομίσῃ τάδε λέγεσθαι [think these things are said from enmity more than blame]. αἰτία μὲν γὰρ [For blame is] φίλων ἀνδρῶν ἁμαρτανόντων [of friends making mistakes] κατηγορία δὲ ἐχθρῶν ἀδικησάντων [but accusation of enemies having done wrong].

καὶ ἅμα [And at the same time] εἴπερ τινὲς καὶ ἄλλοι [if any others] ἄξιοι νομίζομεν εἶναι [we think ourselves worthy] τοῖς πέλας ψόγον ἐπενεγκεῖν [to bring blame against others] ἄλλως τε καὶ [especially] μεγάλων τῶν διαφερόντων καθεστώτων [since the critical issues are great] περὶ ὧν οὐκ αἰσθάνεσθαι ἡμῖν γε δοκεῖτε [about which you do not seem to us to be aware] οὐδ’ ἐκλογίσασθαι πώποτε [nor ever to have considered] πρὸς οἵους ὑμῖν Ἀθηναίους ὄντας [against what sort of people, being Athenians, for you] καὶ ὅσον ὑμῶν καὶ ὡς πᾶν διαφέροντας ὁ ἀγὼν ἔσται [and how different from you in every way the struggle will be].

οἱ μέν γε [The former are] νεωτεροποιοὶ [innovators] καὶ ἐπινοῆσαι ὀξεῖς [and quick to devise] καὶ ἐπιτελέσαι ἔργῳ ἃ ἂν γνῶσιν [and to accomplish in deed whatever they decide]. ὑμεῖς δὲ [But you are] τὰ ὑπάρχοντά τε σῴζειν [both to preserve what you have] καὶ ἐπιγνῶναι μηδέν [and to devise nothing new] καὶ ἔργῳ οὐδὲ τἀναγκαῖα ἐξικέσθαι [and in deed not even to achieve what is necessary].

αὖθις δὲ οἱ μὲν [And again the former are] καὶ παρὰ δύναμιν τολμηταὶ [both daring beyond their power] καὶ παρὰ γνώμην κινδυνευταὶ [and adventurous beyond calculation] καὶ ἐν τοῖς δεινοῖς εὐέλπιδες [and hopeful in dangers]. τὸ δὲ ὑμέτερον [But your way is] τῆς τε δυνάμεως ἐνδεᾶ πρᾶξαι [to do less than you are able] τῆς τε γνώμης μηδὲ τοῖς βεβαίοις πιστεῦσαι [and of your judgment, not even to trust what is certain] τῶν τε δεινῶν μηδέποτε οἴεσθαι ἀπολυθήσεσθαι [and of dangers, never to expect to be freed].

καὶ μὴν καὶ ἄοκνοι [And truly tireless] πρὸς ὑμᾶς μελλητάς [compared to you procrastinators] καὶ ἀποδημηταὶ [and travelers abroad] πρὸς ἐνδημοτάτους [compared to those most staying at home]. οἴονται γὰρ οἱ μὲν [For they think] τῇ ἀπουσίᾳ ἄν τι κτᾶσθαι [by their absence to acquire something] ὑμεῖς δὲ [but you] τῷ ἐπελθεῖν καὶ τὰ ἑτοῖμα ἂν βλάψαι [by attacking even to harm what is at hand].

κρατοῦντες τε τῶν ἐχθρῶν [And when prevailing over the enemy] ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἐξέρχονται [they go out furthest] καὶ νικώμενοι [and when being defeated] ἐπ’ ἐλάχιστον ἀναπίπτουσιν [they retreat least].

ἔτι δὲ [And further] τοῖς μὲν σώμασιν ἀλλοτριωτάτοις ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως χρῶνται [they use their bodies as things most belonging to others for the sake of the city] τῇ δὲ γνώμῃ οἰκειοτάτῃ ἐς τὸ πράσσειν τι ὑπὲρ αὐτῆς [but their judgment as something most belonging to themselves in order to do something for its sake].

καὶ ἃ μὲν ἂν ἐπινοήσαντες μὴ ἐπεξέλθωσιν [And whatever they may have devised and not carry out] οἰκείων στέρεσθαι ἡγοῦνται [they consider to be deprived of their possessions]. ἃ δ’ ἂν ἐπελθόντες κτήσωνται [But whatever they may have attacked and acquired] ὀλίγα πρὸς τὰ μέλλοντα τυχεῖν πράξαντες [having done little in comparison to what they are about to obtain]. ἢν δ’ ἄρα του καὶ πείρᾳ σφαλῶσιν [And if, after all, they are frustrated in any attempt] ἀντελπίσαντες ἄλλα ἐπλήρωσαν τὴν χρείαν [having hoped for other things in turn, they fulfilled the need]. μόνοι γὰρ [For they alone] ἔχουσί τε ὁμοίως καὶ ἐλπίζουσιν [both possess and hope for equally] ἃ ἂν ἐπινοήσωσι [whatever they may devise] διὰ τὸ ταχεῖαν τὴν ἐπιχείρησιν ποιεῖσθαι ὧν ἂν γνῶσιν [because of making a swift attempt at whatever they decide].

καὶ ταῦτα μετὰ πόνων πάντα καὶ κινδύνων [And all these things with toils and dangers] δι’ ὅλου τοῦ αἰῶνος μοχθοῦσι [they toil through their whole life] καὶ ἀπολαύουσιν ἐλάχιστα τῶν ὑπαρχόντων [and they enjoy very little of their possessions] διὰ τὸ αἰεὶ κτᾶσθαι [because of always acquiring more] καὶ μήτε ἑορτὴν ἄλλο τι ἡγεῖσθαι ἢ τὸ τὰ δέοντα πρᾶξαι [and considering a festival nothing other than doing what is necessary] ξυμφοράν τε οὐχ ἧσσον ἡσυχίαν ἀπράγμονα ἢ ἀσχολίαν ἐπίπονον [and misfortune no less inactivity without troubles than burdensome business].

ὥστε εἴ τις αὐτοὺς ξυνελὼν φαίη [So that if anyone summarizing were to say about them] πεφυκέναι ἐπὶ τῷ μήτε αὐτοὺς ἔχειν ἡσυχίαν μήτε τοὺς ἄλλους ἀνθρώπους ἐᾶν [that they are by nature disposed neither themselves to have quiet nor to allow other men to have it] ὀρθῶς ἂν εἴποι [he would speak correctly].

ταύτης μέντοι τοιαύτης ἀντικαθεστηκυίας πόλεως [Of this city, however, such and so arrayed against you], ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι [Lacedaemonians], διαμέλλετε [you delay] καὶ οἴεσθε [and think] τὴν ἡσυχίαν [that quiet] οὐ τούτοις τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἀρκεῖν [is most sufficient not for these of men] οἳ ἂν [who] τῇ μὲν παρασκευῇ δίκαια πράσσωσι [on the one hand, in preparation, act justly] τῇ δὲ γνώμῃ [but in their judgment], ἢν ἀδικῶνται [if they are wronged], δῆλοι ὦσι μὴ ἐπιτρέψοντες [are clearly not going to permit it] ἀλλ’ [but] ἐπὶ τῷ μὴ λυπεῖν τε τοὺς ἄλλους καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀμυνόμενοι μὴ βλάπτεσθαι τὸ ἴσον νέμετε [on the condition of neither harming others and themselves by defending not being harmed, you share equally].

μόλις δ’ ἂν [And you would hardly] πόλει ὁμοίᾳ παροικοῦντες ἐτυγχάνετε τούτου [living next to a similar city, obtain this]. νῦν δέ [But now], ὅπερ καὶ ἄρτι ἐδηλώσαμεν [which also we just now made clear] ἀρχαιότροπα ὑμῶν τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα πρὸς αὐτούς ἐστιν [your ways are old-fashioned in comparison to them].

ἀνάγκη δὲ [And it is necessary] ὥσπερ τέχνης [just as in an art] αἰεὶ τὰ ἐπιγιγνόμενα κρατεῖν [for later inventions always to prevail]. καὶ ἡσυχαζούσῃ μὲν πόλει τὰ ἀκίνητα νόμιμα ἄριστα [And for a city remaining quiet, unchanging customs are best] πρὸς πολλὰ δὲ ἀναγκαζομένοις ἰέναι [but for those compelled to engage in many things] πολλῆς καὶ τῆς ἐπιτεχνήσεως δεῖ [there is need also of much ingenuity]. δι’ ὅπερ καὶ τὰ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἀπὸ τῆς πολυπειρίας ἐπὶ πλέον ὑμῶν κεκαίνωται [For this reason also the practices of the Athenians from their abundant experience have been innovated more than yours].

μέχρι μὲν οὖν τοῦδε ὡρίσθω ὑμῶν ἡ βραδυτής [Up to this point therefore let your slowness be defined]. νῦν δὲ [But now] τοῖς τε ἄλλοις καὶ Ποτειδεάταις [both to the others and to the Potidaeans] ὥσπερ ὑπεδέξασθε [as you promised] βοηθήσατε κατὰ τάχος [help quickly] ἐσβαλόντες ἐς τὴν Ἀττικήν [having invaded Attica] ἵνα μὴ [so that you may not] ἄνδρας τε φίλους καὶ ξυγγενεῖς [both men who are friends and kinsmen] τοῖς ἐχθίστοις προῆσθε [abandon to their worst enemies] καὶ ἡμᾶς τοὺς ἄλλους [and us the rest] ἀθυμίᾳ [by despondency] πρὸς ἑτέραν τινὰ ξυμμαχίαν τρέψητε [turn to some other alliance].

δρῷμεν δ’ ἂν ἄδικον οὐδέν [And we would do nothing unjust] οὔτε πρὸς θεῶν τῶν ὁρκίων [neither in the sight of the gods of oaths] οὔτε πρὸς ἀνθρώπων τῶν αἰσθανομένων [nor of men who understand]. λύουσι γὰρ σπονδάς [For they break treaties] οὐχ οἱ δι’ ἐρημίαν ἄλλοις προσιόντες [not those approaching others through abandonment] ἀλλ’ οἱ μὴ βοηθοῦντες οἷς ἂν ξυνομόσωσιν [but those not helping those with whom they have made a treaty].

βουλομένων δὲ ὑμῶν προθύμων εἶναι μενοῦμεν [And if you are willing to be zealous, we will remain]. οὔτε γὰρ ὅσια ἂν ποιοῖμεν μεταβαλλόμενοι [For we would do nothing holy by changing] οὔτε ξυνηθεστέρους ἂν ἄλλους εὕροιμεν [nor would we find others more accustomed to us].

πρὸς τάδε βουλεύεσθε εὖ [Deliberate well on these things] καὶ τὴν Πελοπόννησον πειρᾶσθε μὴ ἐλάσσω ἐξηγεῖσθαι [and try to rule the Peloponnese no less] ἢ οἱ πατέρες ὑμῖν παρέδοσαν [than your fathers handed down to you].

τοιαῦτα μὲν οἱ Κορίνθιοι εἶπον [Such things the Corinthians said]. τῶν δὲ Ἀθηναίων [But of the Athenians] ἔτυχε γὰρ πρεσβεία [for an embassy happened] πρότερον ἐν τῇ Λακεδαίμονι [previously in Lacedaemon] περὶ ἄλλων παροῦσα [being present concerning other things] καὶ ὡς ᾔσθοντο τῶν λόγων [and when they learned of the speeches] ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς [it seemed best to them] παριτητέα εἶναι ἐς τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους [that it was necessary to go before the Lacedaemonians] τῶν μὲν ἐγκλημάτων πέρι μηδὲν ἀπολογησομένους [not to make a defense about the accusations] ὧν αἱ πόλεις ἐνεκάλουν [which the cities were bringing] δηλῶσαι δὲ περὶ τοῦ παντός [but to make clear concerning the whole matter] ὡς οὐ ταχέως αὐτοῖς βουλευτέον εἴη [that it was not necessary for them to decide quickly] ἀλλ’ ἐν πλέονι σκεπτέον [but to consider it more fully]. καὶ ἅμα τὴν σφετέραν πόλιν ἐβούλοντο σημῆναι [And at the same time they wanted to indicate their own city] ὅση εἴη δύναμιν [how great it was in power] καὶ ὑπόμνησιν ποιήσασθαι [and to make a reminder] τοῖς τε πρεσβυτέροις ὧν ᾔδεσαν [both to the older men of what they knew] καὶ τοῖς νεωτέροις ἐξήγησιν ὧν ἄπειροι ἦσαν [and to the younger an explanation of which things they were ignorant] νομίζοντες [thinking] μᾶλλον ἂν αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῶν λόγων πρὸς τὸ ἡσυχάζειν τραπέσθαι ἢ πρὸς τὸ πολεμεῖν [that from the speeches they would be more likely to turn towards peace than towards war].

προσελθόντες οὖν τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις ἔφασαν [Therefore, having approached the Lacedaemonians, they said] βούλεσθαι καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐς τὸ πλῆθος αὐτῶν εἰπεῖν [that they themselves also wished to speak to their assembly] εἴ τι μὴ ἀποκωλύοι [if nothing prevented it]. οἱ δὲ ἐκέλευόν τε παριέναι [And they ordered them to come forward] καὶ παρελθόντες οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἔλεγον τοιάδε [and, having come forward, the Athenians said the following things].

ἡ μὲν πρεσβεία ἡμῶν [Our embassy] οὐκ ἐς ἀντιλογίαν τοῖς ὑμετέροις ξυμμάχοις ἐγένετο [was not for disputation with your allies] ἀλλὰ περὶ ὧν ἡ πόλις ἔπεμψεν [but concerning the matters for which our city sent us]. αἰσθανόμενοι δὲ καταβοὴν οὐκ ὀλίγην οὖσαν ἡμῶν [But perceiving that there was no small outcry against us] παρήλθομεν [we have come forward] οὐ τοῖς ἐγκλήμασι τῶν πόλεων ἀντεροῦντες [not to speak against the accusations of the cities] (οὐ γὰρ [for not] παρὰ δικασταῖς ὑμῖν [with you as judges] οὔτε ἡμῶν οὔτε τούτων οἱ λόγοι ἂν γίγνοιντο [would the speeches either of us or of them be made]) ἀλλ’ ὅπως [but so that] μὴ ῥᾳδίως περὶ μεγάλων πραγμάτων τοῖς ξυμμάχοις πειθόμενοι χεῖρον βουλεύσησθε [you might not, by readily trusting your allies concerning important matters, make a worse decision] καὶ ἅμα βουλόμενοι [and at the same time wishing] περὶ τοῦ παντὸς λόγου τοῦ ἐς ἡμᾶς καθεστῶτος δηλῶσαι [to set forth concerning the whole account that stands against us] ὡς οὔτε ἀπεικότως ἔχομεν ἃ κεκτήμεθα [that we hold our possessions not unreasonably] ἥ τε πόλις ἡμῶν ἀξία λόγου ἐστίν [and our city is worthy of account].

καὶ τὰ μὲν πάνυ παλαιὰ [And the very ancient things] τί δεῖ λέγειν [what need is there to say] ὧν [of which things] ἀκοαὶ μᾶλλον λόγων μάρτυρες ἢ ὄψις τῶν ἀκουσομένων [rumors rather than sight are witnesses for those who hear]? τὰ δὲ Μηδικά [But the Persian things] καὶ ὅσα αὐτοὶ ξύνιστε [and as many as you yourselves know] εἰ καὶ δι’ ὄχλου μᾶλλον ἔσται [even if it will be rather tedious] ἀεὶ προβαλλομένοις [to those always bringing them forward] ἀνάγκη λέγειν [it is necessary to speak]. καὶ γὰρ ὅτε ἐδρῶμεν [And for when we were acting] ἐπ’ ὠφελίᾳ ἐκινδυνεύετο [they were risked for benefit] ἧς [of which] τοῦ μὲν ἔργου μέρος μετέσχετε [you partook of the deed part] τοῦ δὲ λόγου μὴ παντός [but not of the full account] εἴ τι ὠφελεῖ στερισκώμεθα [if this does any good, may we be deprived].

ῥηθήσεται δὲ [And it will be said] οὐ παραιτήσεως μᾶλλον ἕνεκα [not for the sake of excuse] ἢ μαρτυρίου καὶ δηλώσεως [but of testimony and demonstration] πρὸς οἵαν ὑμῖν πόλιν [against what sort of city for you] μὴ εὖ βουλευομένοις ὁ ἀγὼν καταστήσεται [if you do not decide well, the struggle will arise].

φαμὲν γὰρ [For we say] Μαραθῶνί τε μόνοι προκινδυνεῦσαι τῷ βαρβάρῳ [that at Marathon we alone first faced the danger to the barbarian] καὶ ὅτε τὸ ὕστερον ἦλθεν [and when he came later] οὐχ ἱκανοὶ ὄντες κατὰ γῆν ἀμύνεσθαι [not being sufficient to defend by land] ἐσβάντες ἐς τὰς ναῦς πανδημεὶ [having embarked on the ships with all the people] ἐν Σαλαμῖνι ξυνναυμαχῆσαι [at Salamis we fought together in the sea battle] ὅπερ ἔσχε [which prevented] μὴ [him not] κατὰ πόλεις αὐτὸν ἐπιπλέοντα τὴν Πελοπόννησον πορθεῖν [sailing against the cities to ravage the Peloponnese] ἀδυνάτων ἂν ὄντων [since it would have been impossible] πρὸς ναῦς πολλὰς ἀλλήλοις ἐπιβοηθεῖν [for many ships to come to each other's aid]. τεκμήριον δὲ μέγιστον αὐτὸς ἐποίησεν [And he himself made the greatest proof]. νικηθεὶς γὰρ ταῖς ναυσίν [For, having been defeated by the ships] ὡς οὐκέτι αὐτῷ ὁμοίας οὔσης τῆς δυνάμεως [as his strength no longer being equal] κατὰ τάχος τῷ πλέονι τοῦ στρατοῦ ἀνεχώρησεν [he retreated quickly with the greater part of his army].

τοιούτου μέντοι τούτου ξυμβάντος [With this event therefore having happened] καὶ σαφῶς δηλωθέντος [and having been clearly shown] ὅτι ἐν ταῖς ναυσὶ τῶν Ἑλλήνων τὰ πράγματα ἐγένετο [that the affairs of the Greeks depended on ships] τρία τὰ ὠφελιμώτατα ἐς αὐτὸ παρεσχόμεθα [we provided the three most useful things for this purpose]. ἀριθμόν τε νεῶν πλεῖστον [both the greatest number of ships] καὶ ἄνδρα στρατηγὸν ξυνετώτατον [and a most intelligent man as general] καὶ προθυμίαν ἀοκνοτάτην [and most unhesitating zeal]. ναῦς μέν γε [Ships indeed] ἐς τὰς τετρακοσίας [up to four hundred] ὀλίγῳ ἐλάσσους τῶν δύο μοιρῶν [a little less than two-thirds] Θεμιστοκλέα δὲ ἄρχοντα [and Themistocles as leader] ὃς αἰτιώτατος ἐν τῷ στενῷ ναυμαχῆσαι ἐγένετο [who became most responsible for fighting the naval battle in the straits] ὅπερ σαφέστατα ἔσωσε τὰ πράγματα [which thing most clearly saved the situation]. καὶ αὐτὸν διὰ τοῦτο ὑμεῖς ἐτιμήσατε [And you honored him on account of this] μάλιστα δὴ ἄνδρα ξένον τῶν ὡς ὑμᾶς ἐλθόντων [most certainly, a foreign man of those having come to you]. προθυμίαν δὲ καὶ πολὺ τολμηροτάτην ἐδείξαμεν [And we showed zeal also very most bold] οἵ γε [we who] ἐπειδὴ ἡμῖν κατὰ γῆν οὐδεὶς ἐβοήθει [when no one was helping us by land] τῶν ἄλλων ἤδη μέχρι ἡμῶν δουλευόντων [with the rest now enslaved as far as ourselves] ἠξιώσαμεν [we resolved] ἐκλιπόντες τὴν πόλιν καὶ τὰ οἰκεῖα διαφθείραντες [having left the city and having destroyed our belongings] μηδ’ ὣς τὸ τῶν περιλοίπων ξυμμάχων κοινὸν προλιπεῖν [not even thus to abandon the common cause of the remaining allies] μηδὲ σκεδασθέντες ἀχρεῖοι αὐτοῖς γενέσθαι [nor having been scattered to be useless to them] ἀλλ’ ἐσβάντες ἐς τὰς ναῦς κινδυνεῦσαι [but having embarked upon the ships to take the risk].

καὶ μὴ ὀργισθῆναι [and not to be angry] ὅτι ἡμῖν οὐ προυτιμωρήσατε [because you did not help us first]. ὥστε φαμὲν [Therefore we say] οὐχ ἧσσον αὐτοὶ ὠφελῆσαι ὑμᾶς [that we ourselves benefited you no less] ἢ τυχεῖν τούτου [than to have obtained this]. ὑμεῖς μὲν γὰρ [For you] ἀπό τε οἰκουμένων τῶν πόλεων [both from inhabited cities] καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ τὸ λοιπὸν νέμεσθαι [and on condition of enjoying them for the future] ἐπειδὴ ἐδείσατε [after you feared] ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν καὶ οὐχ ἡμῶν τὸ πλέον [for your own safety and not for ours more] ἐβοηθήσατε [came to help] (ὅτε γοῦν ἦμεν ἔτι σῶοι οὐ παρεγένεσθε [at any rate when we were still safe you were not present]). ἡμεῖς δὲ [But we] ἀπό τε τῆς οὐκ οὔσης ἔτι ὁρμώμενοι [both setting out from what was no longer existing] καὶ ὑπὲρ τῆς ἐν βραχείᾳ ἐλπίδι οὔσης κινδυνεύοντες [and taking risks on behalf of what was in slight hope] ξυνεσώσαμεν [helped to save] ὑμᾶς τε τὸ μέρος καὶ ἡμᾶς αὐτούς [both your part and ourselves].

εἰ δὲ προσεχωρήσαμεν πρότερον τῷ Μήδῳ [And if we had previously gone over to the Mede] δείσαντες ὥσπερ καὶ ἄλλοι [being afraid just as others] περὶ τῇ χώρᾳ [for our land] ἢ μὴ ἐτολμήσαμεν ὕστερον ἐσβῆναι ἐς τὰς ναῦς [or had not dared later to embark on the ships] ὡς διεφθαρμένοι [as having been destroyed] οὐδὲν ἂν ἔδει ἔτι ὑμᾶς [there would no longer be need for you] μὴ ἔχοντας ναῦς ἱκανὰς ναυμαχεῖν [not having sufficient ships, to fight a naval battle] ἀλλὰ [but] καθ’ ἡσυχίαν ἂν αὐτῷ προυχώρησε τὰ πράγματα [the matters would have advanced for him quietly] ᾗ ἐβούλετο [as he wished].

ἆρ’ ἄξιοί ἐσμεν [Are we worthy], ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι [Lacedaemonians], καὶ προθυμίας ἕνεκα τῆς τότε καὶ γνώμης ξυνέσεως [both on account of our zeal at that time and the wisdom of our decision] ἀρχῆς γε ἧς ἔχομεν τοῖς Ἕλλησι μὴ οὕτως ἄγαν ἐπιφθόνως διακεῖσθαι [of the rule which we have over the Greeks, not to be so envied]?

καὶ γὰρ αὐτὴν τήνδε ἐλάβομεν [For we received this very thing] οὐ βιασάμενοι [not having taken it by force] ἀλλ’ ὑμῶν μὲν οὐκ ἐθελησάντων παραμεῖναι [but with you not having been willing to remain] πρὸς τὰ ὑπόλοιπα τοῦ βαρβάρου [for the remaining matters of the barbarian] ἡμῖν δὲ προσελθόντων τῶν ξυμμάχων [and the allies having come to us] καὶ αὐτῶν δεηθέντων ἡγεμόνας καταστῆναι [and themselves having asked us to become leaders].

ἐξ αὐτοῦ δὲ τοῦ ἔργου κατηναγκάσθημεν [And from the very deed we were compelled] τὸ πρῶτον προαγαγεῖν αὐτὴν ἐς τόδε [at first to advance it to this point] μάλιστα μὲν ὑπὸ δέους [most of all by fear] ἔπειτα καὶ τιμῆς [then also by honor] ὕστερον καὶ ὠφελίας [later also by advantage].

καὶ οὐκ ἀσφαλὲς ἔτι ἐδόκει εἶναι [And it no longer seemed to be safe] τοῖς πολλοῖς ἀπηχθημένους [for the majority being hated] καί τινων καὶ ἤδη ἀποστάντων κατεστραμμένων [and some already having revolted and been subdued] ὑμῶν τε ἡμῖν οὐκέτι ὁμοίως φίλων [and with you no longer similarly friendly to us] ἀλλ’ ὑπόπτων καὶ διαφόρων ὄντων [but being suspicious and hostile] ἀνέντας κινδυνεύειν [to relax and risk danger]. καὶ γὰρ ἂν αἱ ἀποστάσεις πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐγίγνοντο [For the revolts would be to your side].

πᾶσι δὲ ἀνεπίφθονον [And it is not to be blamed in anyone] τὰ ξυμφέροντα τῶν μεγίστων πέρι κινδύνων εὖ τίθεσθαι [to arrange well one's advantage concerning the greatest dangers].

ὑμεῖς γοῦν [You at any rate], ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι [Lacedaemonians], τὰς ἐν τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ πόλεις [the cities in the Peloponnese] ἐπὶ τὸ ὑμῖν ὠφέλιμον καταστησάμενοι ἐξηγεῖσθε [having arranged for your own advantage, you lead]. καὶ εἰ τότε ὑπομείναντες [And if at that time, having remained] διὰ παντὸς ἀπήχθεσθε ἐν τῇ ἡγεμονίᾳ [you were hated through everything in the leadership] ὥσπερ ἡμεῖς [like us] εὖ ἴσμεν [we know well] μὴ ἂν ἧσσον ὑμᾶς λυπηροὺς γενομένους τοῖς ξυμμάχοις [that you would have become no less burdensome to the allies] καὶ ἀναγκασθέντας ἂν [and having been compelled] ἢ ἄρχειν ἐγκρατῶς [either to rule firmly] ἢ αὐτοὺς κινδυνεύειν [or yourselves to be in danger].

οὕτως οὐδ’ ἡμεῖς [Thus we also] θαυμαστὸν οὐδὲν πεποιήκαμεν [have done nothing wondrous] οὐδ’ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνθρωπείου τρόπου [nor contrary to human nature] εἰ ἀρχήν τε διδομένην ἐδεξάμεθα [if we both accepted leadership being given] καὶ ταύτην μὴ ἀνεῖμεν [and did not let it go] ὑπὸ τῶν τριῶν τῶν μεγίστων νικηθέντες [having been conquered by the three greatest things] τιμῆς καὶ δέους καὶ ὠφελίας [honor and fear and advantage]. οὐδ’ αὖ πρῶτοι τοῦ τοιούτου ὑπάρξαντες [nor again having been the first of such behavior] ἀλλ’ αἰεὶ καθεστῶτος [but with it always being established] τὸν ἥσσω ὑπὸ τοῦ δυνατωτέρου κατείργεσθαι [that the weaker be ruled by the stronger]. ἄξιοί τε ἅμα νομίζοντες εἶναι [both at the same time thinking ourselves worthy] καὶ ὑμῖν δοκοῦντες [and seeming so to you] μέχρι οὗ τὰ ξυμφέροντα λογιζόμενοι τῷ δικαίῳ λόγῳ νῦν χρῆσθε [until calculating your own interests you now use the just argument] ὃν οὐδείς πω [which no one yet] παρατυχὸν ἰσχύι τι κτήσασθαι προθεὶς [having set before himself the acquisition of something by strength having presented itself] τοῦ μὴ πλέον ἔχειν ἀπετράπετο [turned away from not having more].

ἐπαινεῖσθαί τε ἄξιοι [And those are worthy to be praised] οἵτινες [who] χρησάμενοι τῇ ἀνθρωπείᾳ φύσει [having followed human nature] ὥστε ἑτέρων ἄρχειν [so as to rule others] δικαιότεροι ἢ κατὰ τὴν ὑπάρχουσαν δύναμιν γένωνται [become more just than in accordance with their existing power].

ἄλλους γ’ ἂν οὖν οἰόμεθα [We therefore suppose others] τὰ ἡμέτερα λαβόντας [having received our things] δεῖξαι ἂν [would show] μάλιστα εἴ τι μετριάζομεν [most of all if we act with moderation]. ἡμῖν δὲ καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ἐπιεικοῦς [But for us, even from what is reasonable] ἀδοξία τὸ πλέον ἢ ἔπαινος οὐκ εἰκότως περιέστη [dishonor more than praise has arisen undeservedly].

καὶ ἐλασσούμενοι γὰρ [For even yielding] ἐν ταῖς ξυμβολαίαις πρὸς τοὺς ξυμμάχους δίκαις [in contracted agreements with the allies] καὶ παρ’ ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς [and among ourselves] ἐν τοῖς ὁμοίοις νόμοις ποιήσαντες τὰς κρίσεις [making judgments under similar laws] φιλοδικεῖν δοκοῦμεν [we seem to be lovers of litigation].

καὶ οὐδείς [And no one] σκοπεῖ αὐτῶν [considers among them] τοῖς καὶ ἄλλοθί που ἀρχὴν ἔχουσι [those somewhere else having rule] καὶ ἧσσον ἡμῶν πρὸς τοὺς ὑπηκόους μετρίοις οὖσι [and being less moderate than we are towards their subjects] διότι τοῦτο οὐκ ὀνειδίζεται [why this is not reproached]. βιάζεσθαι γὰρ οἷς ἂν ἐξῇ [For to use force whenever possible] δικάζεσθαι οὐδὲν προσδέονται [they have no need to go to trial].

οἱ δὲ [But those] εἰθισμένοι πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου ὁμιλεῖν [accustomed to deal with us on equal terms] ἤν τι [if in anything] παρὰ τὸ μὴ οἴεσθαι χρῆναι [contrary to what they suppose to be right] ἢ γνώμῃ ἢ δυνάμει τῇ διὰ τὴν ἀρχὴν [either in judgment or in power because of our rule] καὶ ὁπωσοῦν ἐλασσωθῶσιν [and in any way be put in an inferior position] οὐ τοῦ πλέονος μὴ στερισκόμενοι χάριν ἔχουσιν [they are not grateful for not being deprived of more] ἀλλὰ τοῦ ἐνδεοῦς χαλεπώτερον φέρουσιν [but they bear the deficiency more тяжело] ἢ εἰ ἀπὸ πρώτης ἀποθέμενοι τὸν νόμον φανερῶς ἐπλεονεκτοῦμεν [than if, from the first, having put aside the law, we were openly taking advantage]. ἐκείνως δὲ οὐδ’ ἂν αὐτοὶ ἀντέλεγον [And in that case they would not themselves even object] ὡς οὐ χρεὼν τὸν ἥσσω τῷ κρατοῦντι ὑποχωρεῖν [that it is not necessary for the weaker to yield to the stronger].

ἀδικούμενοί τε [And being wronged], ὡς ἔοικεν [as it seems], οἱ ἄνθρωποι μᾶλλον ὀργίζονται ἢ βιαζόμενοι [men are more angered than if being forced]. τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἴσου δοκεῖ πλεονεκτεῖσθαι [For the former seems to be taking advantage from equality] τὸ δ’ ἀπὸ τοῦ κρείσσονος καταναγκάζεσθαι [the latter to be compelling from superiority].

ὑπὸ γοῦν τοῦ Μήδου [Therefore by the Mede] δεινότερα τούτων πάσχοντες ἠνείχοντο [suffering things worse than these, they tolerated them]. ἡ δὲ ἡμετέρα ἀρχὴ χαλεπὴ δοκεῖ εἶναι [But our rule seems to be harsh] εἰκότως [reasonably]. τὸ παρὸν γὰρ αἰεὶ βαρὺ τοῖς ὑπηκόοις [For what is present is always burdensome to subjects].

ὑμεῖς γ’ ἂν οὖν [You therefore] εἰ καθελόντες ἡμᾶς ἄρξαιτε [if, having overthrown us, you should rule] τάχα ἂν τὴν εὔνοιαν [perhaps the goodwill] ἣν διὰ τὸ ἡμέτερον δέος εἰλήφατε μεταβάλοιτε [which on account of your fear of us you have obtained, you would change] εἴπερ [if] οἷα καὶ τότε πρὸς τὸν Μῆδον δι’ ὀλίγου ἡγησάμενοι ὑπεδείξατε [such as also then against the Persian, having thought for a short time, you showed] ὁμοῖα καὶ νῦν γνώσεσθε [you will know similar things now also]. ἄμεικτα γὰρ [For you have customs unmixed] τά τε καθ’ ὑμᾶς αὐτοὺς νόμιμα τοῖς ἄλλοις ἔχετε [your own customs with those of the others] καὶ προσέτι [and in addition] εἷς ἕκαστος ἐξιών [each man going out] οὔτε τούτοις χρῆται [neither uses these] οὔθ’ οἷς ἡ ἄλλη Ἑλλὰς νομίζει [nor what the rest of Greece practices].

βουλεύεσθε οὖν βραδέως [Therefore deliberate slowly] ὡς οὐ περὶ βραχέων [as not concerning small matters] καὶ μὴ ἀλλοτρίαις γνώμαις καὶ ἐγκλήμασι πεισθέντες [and not having been persuaded by the opinions and complaints of others] οἰκεῖον πόνον πρόσθησθε [add trouble of your own]. τοῦ δὲ πολέμου τὸν παράλογον [And the unexpectedness of war] ὅσος ἐστί [how great it is] πρὶν ἐν αὐτῷ γενέσθαι προδιάγνωτε [before being in it, consider beforehand]. μηκυνόμενος γὰρ [For being prolonged] φιλεῖ ἐς τύχας τὰ πολλὰ περιίστασθαι [it is accustomed mostly to turn to chance events] ὧν ἴσον τε ἀπέχομεν [from which we are equally distant] καὶ ὁποτέρως ἔσται ἐν ἀδήλῳ κινδυνεύεται [and how it will be is risked in uncertainty].

ἰόντες τε οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἐς τοὺς πολέμους [And men, going into wars] τῶν ἔργων πρότερον ἔχονται [resort to deeds before] ἃ χρῆν ὕστερον δρᾶν [which things it was necessary to do later] κακοπαθοῦντες δὲ ἤδη τῶν λόγων ἅπτονται [and, already suffering hardships, they resort to words].

ἡμεῖς δὲ [But we] ἐν οὐδεμιᾷ πω τοιαύτῃ ἁμαρτίᾳ ὄντες [being in no such error yet] οὔτ’ αὐτοὶ οὔθ’ ὑμᾶς ὁρῶντες λέγομεν ὑμῖν [seeing neither ourselves nor you, we say to you] ἕως ἔτι αὐθαίρετος ἀμφοτέροις ἡ εὐβουλία [while good counsel is still possible for both of us] σπονδὰς μὴ λύειν μηδὲ παραβαίνειν τοὺς ὅρκους [not to break the treaty nor to violate the oaths] τὰ δὲ διάφορα δίκῃ λύεσθαι κατὰ τὴν ξυνθήκην [but to resolve the differences by justice according to the agreement]. εἰ δὲ μή [but if not] θεοὺς τοὺς ὁρκίους μάρτυρας ποιούμενοι [making the gods of oaths witnesses] πειρασόμεθα ἀμύνεσθαι [we will try to defend ourselves] πολέμου ἄρχοντας ταύτῃ ᾗ ἂν ὑφηγῆσθε [against those beginning war in whatever way you lead].

τοιαῦτα δὲ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι εἶπον [The Athenians said such things]. ἐπειδὴ δὲ [And when] τῶν τε ξυμμάχων ἤκουσαν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι [the Lacedaemonians had heard the allies] τὰ ἐγκλήματα τὰ ἐς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους [the complaints against the Athenians] καὶ τῶν Ἀθηναίων ἃ ἔλεξαν [and what the Athenians said] μεταστησάμενοι πάντας ἐβουλεύοντο [having dismissed everyone, they deliberated] κατὰ σφᾶς αὐτούς [among themselves] περὶ τῶν παρόντων [about the present matters].

καὶ τῶν μὲν πλεόνων [And of the majority] ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ αἱ γνῶμαι ἔφερον [the opinions tended to the same point] ἀδικεῖν τε τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἤδη καὶ πολεμητέα εἶναι ἐν τάχει [both that the Athenians were already doing wrong and that it was necessary to go to war quickly]. παρελθὼν δὲ Ἀρχίδαμος [But Archidamus coming forward] ὁ βασιλεὺς αὐτῶν [their king] ἀνὴρ καὶ ξυνετὸς δοκῶν εἶναι καὶ σώφρων [a man seeming to be both intelligent and prudent] ἔλεξε τοιάδε [said these things].

καὶ αὐτὸς [And I myself] πολλῶν ἤδη πολέμων ἔμπειρός εἰμι [am experienced in many wars already], ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι [Lacedaemonians], καὶ ὑμῶν τοὺς ἐν τῇ αὐτῇ ἡλικίᾳ ὁρῶ [and I see those of you in the same age group] ὥστε [so that] μήτε ἀπειρίᾳ ἐπιθυμῆσαί τινα τοῦ ἔργου [no one should desire the action through inexperience] ὅπερ ἂν οἱ πολλοὶ πάθοιεν [which the many would experience] μήτε ἀγαθὸν καὶ ἀσφαλὲς νομίσαντα [nor considering it good and safe].

εὕροιτε δ’ ἂν τόνδε [And you would find this one] περὶ οὗ νῦν βουλεύεσθε [about which you are now deliberating] οὐκ ἂν ἐλάχιστον γενόμενον [not to be least] εἰ σωφρόνως τις αὐτὸν ἐκλογίζοιτο [if anyone should consider it prudently].

πρὸς μὲν γὰρ Πελοποννησίους καὶ τοὺς ἀστυγείτονας [For against the Peloponnesians and the neighboring peoples] παρόμοιος ἡμῶν ἡ ἀλκή [our defense is similar] καὶ διὰ ταχέων οἷόν τε ἐφ’ ἕκαστα ἐλθεῖν [and it is possible to come against each quickly]. πρὸς δὲ ἄνδρας [But against men] οἳ γῆν τε ἑκὰς ἔχουσι [who both have land far off] καὶ προσέτι θαλάσσης ἐμπειρότατοί εἰσι [and besides are most experienced in seamanship] καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἅπασιν ἄριστα ἐξήρτυνται [and are most excellently equipped in all other things] πλούτῳ τε ἰδίῳ καὶ δημοσίῳ [both in private and public wealth] καὶ ναυσὶ καὶ ἵπποις καὶ ὅπλοις [and in ships and horses and arms] καὶ ὄχλῳ [and in multitude] ὅσος οὐκ ἐν ἄλλῳ ἑνί γε χωρίῳ Ἑλληνικῷ ἐστίν [as great as is not in any other single place in Greece] ἔτι δὲ καὶ ξυμμάχους πολλοὺς φόρου ὑποτελεῖς ἔχουσι [and further they have many allies subject to tribute] πῶς χρὴ [how is it necessary] πρὸς τούτους ῥᾳδίως πόλεμον ἄρασθαι [easily to raise war against these] καὶ τίνι πιστεύσαντας ἀπαρασκεύους ἐπειχθῆναι [and having trusted in what should we hasten unprepared]?

πότερον ταῖς ναυσίν [Is it with ships]? ἀλλ’ ἥσσους ἐσμέν [But we are inferior]. εἰ δὲ μελετήσομεν καὶ ἀντιπαρασκευασόμεθα [But if we shall practice and make counter-preparations] χρόνος ἐνέσται [there will be time involved]. ἀλλὰ τοῖς χρήμασιν [But is it with money]? ἀλλὰ πολλῷ πλέον ἔτι τούτου ἐλλείπομεν [But we are lacking much more still than this] καὶ οὔτε ἐν κοινῷ ἔχομεν [and we have neither in common] οὔτε ἑτοίμως ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων φέρομεν [nor do we readily contribute from our private funds].

τάχ’ ἄν τις θαρσοίη [Perhaps someone might be confident] ὅτι τοῖς ὅπλοις αὐτῶν καὶ τῷ πλήθει ὑπερφέρομεν [that we are superior in arms and number] ὥστε τὴν γῆν δῃοῦν ἐπιφοιτῶντες [so as, attacking, to ravage their land]. τοῖς δὲ ἄλλη γῆ ἐστὶ πολλή [But for them there is much other land] ἧς ἄρχουσι [which they rule] καὶ ἐκ θαλάσσης ὧν δέονται ἐπάξονται [and from the sea they will import what they need].

εἰ δ’ αὖ [And if again] τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἀφιστάναι πειρασόμεθα [we shall try to cause their allies to revolt] δεήσει καὶ τούτοις ναυσὶ βοηθεῖν [it will be necessary also to aid these with ships] τὸ πλέον οὖσι νησιώταις [since they are mostly islanders].

τίς οὖν ἔσται ἡμῶν ὁ πόλεμος [What sort of war therefore will ours be]? εἰ μὴ γὰρ ἢ ναυσὶ κρατήσομεν [For unless we shall prevail with ships] ἢ τὰς προσόδους ἀφαιρήσομεν [or take away the revenues] ἀφ’ ὧν τὸ ναυτικὸν τρέφουσι [from which they support their fleet] βλαψόμεθα τὰ πλείω [we will be harmed more].

κἀν τούτῳ οὐδὲ καταλύεσθαι ἔτι καλόν [And in this situation neither is it any longer honorable to give up] ἄλλως τε καὶ εἰ δόξομεν ἄρξαι μᾶλλον τῆς διαφορᾶς [especially if we shall seem to have started the quarrel rather].

μὴ γὰρ δὴ ἐκείνῃ γε τῇ ἐλπίδι ἐπαιρώμεθα [For let us not be lifted up by that hope] ὡς ταχὺ παυσθήσεται ὁ πόλεμος [that the war will quickly end] ἢν τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν τέμωμεν [if we ravage their land]. δέδοικα δὲ μᾶλλον [But I fear more] μὴ καὶ τοῖς παισὶν αὐτὸν ὑπολίπωμεν [lest we even bequeath it to our children]. οὕτως εἰκὸς [Thus it is likely] Ἀθηναίους [that the Athenians] φρονήματι [by high spirit] μήτε τῇ γῇ δουλεῦσαι [neither to be enslaved by their land] μήτε ὥσπερ ἀπείρους καταπλαγῆναι τῷ πολέμῳ [nor as if inexperienced to be terrified by the war].

οὐ μὴν οὐδέ [However I do not] ἀναισθήτως αὐτοὺς κελεύω [order them unperceived] τούς τε ξυμμάχους ἡμῶν ἐᾶν βλάπτειν καὶ ἐπιβουλεύοντας μὴ καταφωρᾶν [both to allow our allies to be harmed and those plotting against us not to be detected]. ἀλλὰ ὅπλα μὲν μήπω κινεῖν [But not yet to stir arms] πέμπειν δὲ καὶ αἰτιᾶσθαι [but to send and to complain] μήτε πόλεμον ἄγαν δηλοῦντας [neither excessively revealing war] μήθ’ ὡς ἐπιτρέψομεν [nor that we will permit it] κἀν τούτῳ καὶ τὰ ἡμέτερα αὐτῶν ἐξαρτύεσθαι [and meanwhile also to prepare our own resources] ξυμμάχων τε προσαγωγῇ [both by winning over allies] καὶ Ἑλλήνων καὶ βαρβάρων [both of Greeks and barbarians] εἴ ποθέν τινα [if from anywhere] ἢ ναυτικοῦ ἢ χρημάτων δύναμιν προσληψόμεθα [we shall acquire some strength either of ships or money] (ἀνεπίφθονον δέ [and it is not blameworthy] ὅσοι ὥσπερ καὶ ἡμεῖς ὑπ’ Ἀθηναίων ἐπιβουλευόμεθα [for as many as are being plotted against like us by the Athenians] μὴ Ἕλληνας μόνον ἀλλὰ καὶ βαρβάρους προσλαβόντας διασωθῆναι [not Greeks only but also having added barbarians to be saved]) καὶ τὰ αὑτῶν ἅμα ἐκποριζώμεθα [and at the same time let us provide our own resources].

καὶ ἢν μὲν ἐσακούωσί τι πρεσβευομένων ἡμῶν [And if they listen to anything with us sending ambassadors] ταῦτα ἄριστα [these things are best]. ἢν δὲ μή [But if not] διελθόντων ἐτῶν δύο καὶ τριῶν [after two or three years have passed] ἄμεινον ἤδη [better already] ἢν δοκῇ [if it seems good] πεφραγμένοι ἴμεν ἐπ’ αὐτούς [having been prepared let us go against them].

καὶ ἴσως ὁρῶντες ἡμῶν ἤδη τήν τε παρασκευὴν καὶ τοὺς λόγους αὐτῇ ὁμοῖα ὑποσημαίνοντας [And perhaps seeing now our preparation and hinting similar words to it] μᾶλλον ἂν εἴκοιεν [they might yield more] καὶ γῆν ἔτι ἄτμητον ἔχοντες [and while still possessing uncut land] καὶ περὶ παρόντων ἀγαθῶν καὶ οὔπω ἐφθαρμένων βουλευόμενοι [and deliberating about present advantages and not yet destroyed ones].

μὴ γὰρ ἄλλο τι νομίσητε τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν ἢ ὅμηρον ἔχειν [For do not consider their land anything other than a hostage to hold] καὶ οὐχ ἧσσον ὅσῳ ἄμεινον ἐξείργασται [and not less so as it has been better worked]. ἧς φείδεσθαι χρὴ ὡς ἐπὶ πλεῖστον [Which it is necessary to spare as much as possible] καὶ μὴ ἐς ἀπόνοιαν καταστήσαντας αὐτοὺς ἀληπτοτέρους ἔχειν [and not having driven them to desperation, to have them more difficult to capture].

εἰ γὰρ ἀπαράσκευοι [For if unprepared] τοῖς τῶν ξυμμάχων ἐγκλήμασιν ἐπειχθέντες [having yielded to the accusations of the allies] τέμνομεν αὐτήν [we ravage it] ὁρᾶτε [beware] ὅπως μὴ αἴσχιον καὶ ἀπορώτερον τῇ Πελοποννήσῳ πράξομεν [how we will not act more basely and with more difficulty for the Peloponnese].

ἐγκλήματα μὲν γὰρ [For accusations] καὶ πόλεων καὶ ἰδιωτῶν οἷόν τε καταλῦσαι [both of cities and of private individuals it is possible to settle] πόλεμον δὲ [but war] ξύμπαντας ἀραμένους [all having taken up] ἕνεκα τῶν ἰδίων [on account of private matters] ὃν οὐχ ὑπάρχει εἰδέναι καθ’ ὅτι χωρήσει [which it is not possible to know how it will proceed] οὐ ῥᾴδιον εὐπρεπῶς θέσθαι [it is not easy to undertake honorably].

καὶ ἀνανδρία μηδενὶ [And let it not seem to anyone cowardice] πολλοὺς μιᾷ πόλει μὴ ταχὺ ἐπελθεῖν [for many not to attack one city quickly].

εἰσὶ γὰρ καὶ ἐκείνοις [For there are also for them] οὐκ ἐλάσσους χρήματα φέροντες ξύμμαχοι [allies contributing no less money] καὶ ἔστιν ὁ πόλεμος [and war is] οὐχ ὅπλων τὸ πλέον [not of arms mostly] ἀλλὰ δαπάνης [but of expense] δι’ ἣν τὰ ὅπλα ὠφελεῖ [by means of which arms benefit] ἄλλως τε καὶ ἠπειρώταις πρὸς θαλασσίους [especially for land-dwellers against seafarers].

πορισώμεθα οὖν πρῶτον αὐτήν [Therefore let us first provide it] καὶ μὴ τοῖς τῶν ξυμμάχων λόγοις πρότερον ἐπαιρώμεθα [and let us not be previously elated by the words of the allies]. οἵπερ δὲ καὶ τῶν ἀποβαινόντων τὸ πλέον ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα τῆς αἰτίας ἕξομεν [And those who will have most of the responsibility for the outcome in both directions] οὗτοι καὶ καθ’ ἡσυχίαν τι αὐτῶν προΐδωμεν [let these also quietly consider some of these things beforehand].

καὶ τὸ βραδὺ καὶ μέλλον [And the slow and later thing] ὃ μέμφονται μάλιστα ἡμῶν [which they criticize most of us] μὴ αἰσχύνεσθε [do not be ashamed]. σπεύδοντές τε γὰρ [For both hastening] σχολαίτερον ἂν παύσαισθε [you would cease more slowly] διὰ τὸ ἀπαράσκευοι ἐγχειρεῖν [because of attacking unprepared] καὶ ἅμα [and at the same time] ἐλευθέραν καὶ εὐδοξοτάτην πόλιν διὰ παντὸς νεμόμεθα [we occupy a free and most glorious city through and through].

καὶ δύναται [And it is most able] σωφροσύνη ἔμφρων τοῦτ’ εἶναι [wise prudence to be this]. μόνοι γὰρ δι’ αὐτὸ [For we alone, on account of it] εὐπραγίαις τε οὐκ ἐξυβρίζομεν [are not excessively insolent in prosperity] καὶ ξυμφοραῖς ἧσσον ἑτέρων εἴκομεν [and in misfortunes we yield less than others].

τῶν τε ξὺν ἐπαίνῳ ἐξοτρυνόντων ἡμᾶς ἐπὶ τὰ δεινά [And with those urging us on with praise to dangers] παρὰ τὸ δοκοῦν ἡμῖν οὐκ ἐπαιρόμεθα ἡδονῇ [we are not elated by pleasure contrary to what seems best to us] καὶ ἤν τις ἄρα ξὺν κατηγορίᾳ παροξύνῃ [and if after all anyone incites us with accusation] οὐδὲν δὴ μᾶλλον ἀχθεσθέντες ἀνεπείσθημεν [certainly no more having been distressed are we persuaded otherwise].

πολεμικοί τε καὶ εὔβουλοι [And we become both warlike and prudent in counsel] διὰ τὸ εὔκοσμον [because of good order]. τὸ μὲν ὅτι αἰδὼς σωφροσύνης πλεῖστον μετέχει [The former because respect shares most in prudence] αἰσχύνης δὲ εὐψυχία [and courage in shame]. εὔβουλοι δὲ [And prudent in counsel] ἀμαθέστερον τῶν νόμων τῆς ὑπεροψίας παιδευόμενοι [being educated more ignorantly than the laws through disdain] καὶ ξὺν χαλεπότητι σωφρονέστερον ἢ ὥστε αὐτῶν ἀνηκουστεῖν [and with severity more prudently so as not to disobey them]. καὶ μὴ τὰ ἀχρεῖα ξυνετοὶ ἄγαν ὄντες [And not the useless things being too clever] τὰς τῶν πολεμίων παρασκευὰς λόγῳ καλῶς μεμφόμενοι [finding fault well in word with the preparations of the enemy] ἀνομοίως ἔργῳ ἐπεξιέναι [to go against them unequally in deed] νομίζειν δὲ [but to think] τάς τε διανοίας τῶν πέλας παραπλησίους εἶναι [both the thoughts of one's neighbors to be similar] καὶ τὰς προσπιπτούσας τύχας οὐ λόγῳ διαιρετάς [and the chances that befall not divisible by reason].

αἰεὶ δὲ [And always] ὡς πρὸς εὖ βουλευομένους τοὺς ἐναντίους ἔργῳ παρασκευαζόμεθα [as against those well-planning we prepare ourselves by deed]. καὶ οὐκ ἐξ ἐκείνων ὡς ἁμαρτησομένων ἔχειν δεῖ τὰς ἐλπίδας [And it is necessary not to have hopes from them that they will make mistakes] ἀλλ’ ὡς ἡμῶν αὐτῶν ἀσφαλῶς προνοουμένων [but that we ourselves safely take precautions]. πολύ τε διαφέρειν οὐ δεῖ νομίζειν [And it is not necessary to think to be different greatly] ἄνθρωπον ἀνθρώπου [a man from a man] κράτιστον δὲ εἶναι [but it is best] ὅστις ἐν τοῖς ἀναγκαιοτάτοις παιδεύεται [whoever is educated in the most necessary things].

ταύτας οὖν [These practices therefore] ἃς οἱ πατέρες τε ἡμῖν παρέδοσαν [which our fathers handed down to us] καὶ αὐτοὶ διὰ παντὸς ὠφελούμενοι ἔχομεν μὴ παρῶμεν [and we ourselves benefiting from them throughout, let us not abandon] μηδὲ ἐπειχθέντες [nor having been pressured] ἐν βραχεῖ μορίῳ ἡμέρας [in a small part of a day] περὶ πολλῶν σωμάτων καὶ χρημάτων καὶ πόλεων καὶ δόξης βουλεύσωμεν [let us deliberate about many lives and much money and cities and reputation] ἀλλὰ καθ’ ἡσυχίαν [but quietly]. ἔξεστι δ’ ἡμῖν μᾶλλον ἑτέρων διὰ ἰσχύν [And it is possible for us more than others through strength].

καὶ πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους πέμπετε μέν [And send to the Athenians] περὶ τῆς Ποτειδαίας [concerning Potidaea] πέμπετε δὲ περὶ ὧν οἱ ξύμμαχοι φασιν ἀδικεῖσθαι [and send concerning the things about which the allies say they are being wronged] ἄλλως τε καὶ ἑτοίμων ὄντων αὐτῶν δίκας δοῦναι [especially since they are ready to give justice]. ἐπὶ δὲ τὸν διδόντα οὐ πρότερον νόμιμον [And it is not lawful against the one offering] ὡς ἐπ’ ἀδικοῦντα ἰέναι [to proceed as against one doing wrong]. παρασκευάζεσθε δὲ τὸν πόλεμον ἅμα [But prepare for war at the same time]. ταῦτα γὰρ καὶ κράτιστα βουλεύσεσθε [For you will thus both deliberate best] καὶ τοῖς ἐναντίοις φοβερώτατα [and most terribly for your enemies].
