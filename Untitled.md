(c). How to write a permutation in terms of a product of distinct cycles? Write $\tau = (1\;2\;3)(3\;5\;1\;6)$ as a product of disjoint cycles. What is the inverse of $\tau$? What is its order? Is it in $A_6$?

$$\begin{align*}

\tau&=\begin{pmatrix}1&2&3&4&5&6\\6&3&5&4&2&1\end{pmatrix}\\\\
&=\begin{pmatrix}1&6\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}2&3&5\end{pmatrix}

\end{align*}$$
