To show that $H$, which is generated by $\sigma^2$, is normal in $D_6$, which is generated by $\sigma$ and $\tau$, we only need to show that the cosets work over the generators; that is,
$$(\forall (g,\;h)\in\{\sigma,\tau\}\times H)(ghg^{-1}\in H)\text{.}$$
We use the facts that $r^6=s^2=1$, $rsr=s$, and that elements in $H$ are of the form $r^{2k}$, where $k\leq 3$. Now:
$$\begin{align*}

\sigma r^{2k}\sigma^{-1}&=\sigma r^{2k}\sigma^2\\
&=\sigma r^{2k}r^6\\
&=\sigm

\end{align*}$$
