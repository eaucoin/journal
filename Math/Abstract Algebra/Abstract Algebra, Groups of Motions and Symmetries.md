## Definition.

- **Figure**: a finite set of vertices in space.
- **Motion** (of a Figure): a permutation of the vertices of a figure that can be realized by a rigid motion in space.

## Theorem 1.

A polygon with $n$ vertices is a subgroup of $S_n$. 

## Definition.

Let:
- $X_{n}=\{1,2,\dots n\}$ be an index set that is the label of the vertices of a figure,
- $d(x,\;y)$ be the distance between any two vertices with pair labels in $X_n^2$,
- $\sigma$ be a motion acting on the figure.

Then $\sigma$ is a **permutation** of the figure iff
$$(\forall(x,\;y)\in X^2_n)(d())$$
