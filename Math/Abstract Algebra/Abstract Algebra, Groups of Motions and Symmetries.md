## Definition.

- **Figure**: a finite set of vertices in space.
- **Motion** (of a Figure): a permutation of the vertices of a figure that can be realized by a rigid motion in space.

## Theorem 1.

A polygon with $n$ vertices is a subgroup of $S_n$. 

## Definition.

Let $X_{n}=\{1,2,\dots n\}$, and suppose that there exists a figure whose vertices are labeled by the elements of $X_n$. Then, let $d(x,\;y)$ be the distance between any two vertices with pair labels in $X_n^2$. Let $\sigma$ be a motion actin
