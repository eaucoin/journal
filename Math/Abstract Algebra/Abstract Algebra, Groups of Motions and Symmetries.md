## Definition.

- **Figure**: a finite set of vertices in space.
- **Motion** (of a Figure): a permutation of the vertices of a figure that can be realized by a rigid motion in space.

## Theorem 1.

The *set of motions* of a figure with $n$ vertices is a subgroup of $S_n$. 

## Definition.

Let:
- $X_{n}=\{1,2,\dots n\}$ be an index set that is the label of the vertices of a figure,
- $d(x,\;y)$ be the distance between any two vertices with pair labels in $X_n^2$,
- $\sigma$ be a motion acting on the figure,
and suppose for the sake of definition that
$$(\forall k\in X^n)(\sigma k=\sigma(k))\text{.}$$

Then $\sigma$ is a **permutation** of the figure iff
$$(\forall(x,\;y)\in X^2_n)(d(\sigma x,\;\sigma y)=d(x,\;y))\text{.}$$

## Theorem 2.

The *set of symmetries* of a figure with $n$ vertices is a subgroup of $S_n$.

## Definition.

A *regular* $n$-*gon* is an $n$-gon that
