## Definition.

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups, and $\alpha$ a homomorphism between them. The *image* of $\alpha$, written $\text{im}(\alpha)$, is defined by
$$\begin{align*}

\text{im}(\alpha)&=\alpha(G)\\\\
&=\{\alpha(g)\;|\;a\in G\}\text{.}

\end{align*}$$

The *kernel* of $\alpha$, written $\text{ker}(\alpha)$, is defined by
$$\text{ker}(\alpha)=\{k\in G\;|\;\alpha(G)=1\}\text{.}$$

## Theorem 1.

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups, and $\alpha$ a homomorphism between them. Then
