## Definition.

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups and $\alpha$ a homomorphism between them. The *image* of $\alpha$, written $\text{im}(\alpha)$, is defined by
$$\begin{align*}

\text{im}(\alpha)&=\alpha(G)\\\\
&=\{\alpha(g)\;|\;a\in G\}\text{.}

\end{align*}$$

The *kernel* of $\alpha$, written $\text{ker}(\alpha)$, is defined by
$$\text{ker}(\alpha)=\{k\in G\;|\;\alpha(G)=1\}\text{.}$$

## Theorem 1.

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups and $\alpha$ a homomorphism between them. Then
- $\alpha(G)$ is a subgroup of $H$, and
- $\text{ker}(\alpha)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.

## Theorem 2.

$$\begin{align*}

&K\triangleleft G\;\wedge\;\phi:G\rightarrow G/K\\\\

\implies &K=\text{ker}(\phi)\text{.}

\end{align*}$$

## Theorem 3.

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups and $\alpha$ a homomorphism between them. Then $\alpha$ is one-to-one iff $\text{ker}(\alpha)=\{1\}$.
