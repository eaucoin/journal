**1.03)** By the axiom of additive identity, our expression is equal to zero iff adding it to any $a$ gives $a$. Now,
$$a+a0=a1+a0\text{,}$$
by the axiom of multiplicative identity. Then
$$a1+a0=a(1+0)\text{,}$$
by the axiom of distributivity. Then 
$$a(1+0)=a1\text{,}$$
by the law of additive identity. Then
$$a1=a\text{,}$$
by the law of multiplicative identity. So it is
