**1.03)** By the axiom of additive identity, our expression is equal to zero iff adding it to any $a$ gives $a$. Now for an arbitrary $a$,
$$a+a0=a1+a0\text{,}$$
by the axiom of multiplicative identity. Then
$$a1+a0=a(1+0)\text{,}$$
by the axiom of distributivity. Then 
$$a(1+0)=a1\text{,}$$
by the law of additive identity. Then
$$a1=a\text{,}$$
by the law of multiplicative identity. So, it is demonstrated that
$$a+a0=a\text{,}$$
and as a result demonstrated that 
$$a0=0$$
for any arbitrary $a$, as required.

By the axiom of the additive inverse, $(-1)(-1)=1$ iff $(-1)(-1)-1=0$. By what we've
