|Do problems 1.1, 1.4--1.6, 1.8, 1.10, 1.11. These are not to hand in, but **you should write your solutions on paper in order to learn from the work.** We will go over some---but not all---of these problems in class _according to your requests. Let's be partners in this work: You should ask me about the questions you would like me to solve on the board._ You will be responsible for all assigned problems, whether collected or not.|
||Hand in: **1.3, 1.7.** Please remember to write neatly so the grader can read your work, and put your name on your paper so he can record the grades!<br><br>(Remember: **Only** problems in **RED BOLDFACE** are to be handed in by class time to me for grading!)|
