(Hand this problem in!) Prove that the vector product (also called the cross product) of vectors in 3 dimensional space, does not satisfy an associative law for multiplication. (Hint: find a simple example of a cross product of 3 vectors that fails to be associative, showing the calculations. It is easiest to do this with the standard unit vectors: i, j, and k. You should know all the cross products among the three standard unit vectors, i, j, k!)

Take the vectors $\textbf{i}$, $\textbf{j}$, and $\textbf{k}$. Then we have the following results

| Step | Expression                                     | Result       |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1    | $(\textbf{i}\times\textbf{j})$                 | $\textbf{k}$ |
| 1    | $(\textbf{j}\times\textbf{i})$                 | $\textbf{i}$ |
| 2    | $(\textbf{i}\times\textbf{j})\times\textbf{i}$ | $\textbf{0}$ |
| 2    | $\textbf{i}\times(\textbf{j}\times\textbf{i})$ | $0$          |
