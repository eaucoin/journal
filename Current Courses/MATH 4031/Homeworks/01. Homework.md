**1.0**

(Hand this problem in!) Prove that the vector product (also called the cross product) of vectors in 3 dimensional space, does not satisfy an associative law for multiplication. (Hint: find a simple example of a cross product of 3 vectors that fails to be associative, showing the calculations. It is easiest to do this with the standard unit vectors: i, j, and k. You should know all the cross products among the three standard unit vectors, i, j, k!)
