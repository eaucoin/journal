(Hand this problem in!) Prove that the vector product (also called the cross product) of vectors in 3 dimensional space, does not satisfy an associative law for multiplication. (Hint: find a simple example of a cross product of 3 vectors that fails to be associative, showing the calculations. It is easiest to do this with the standard unit vectors: i, j, and k. You should know all the cross products among the three standard unit vectors, i, j, k!)

The formula for the operation--the crossed product of two vectors in three-dimensional real space--is given by 
$$\begin{bmatrix}a_1\\a_2\\a_3\end{bmatrix}\times \begin{bmatrix}b_1\\b_2\\b_3\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}a_\end{bmatrix}$$
