We will update the list of assignments and tests below as the semester progresses. **You will know *an assignment has been updated* if a due-date appropriate to this semester appears in the left-hand column.** However, sometimes we will assign a problem for a certain date and then postpone it because we don't cover as much as planned in class. So check regularly for updates as to what is due and when. If you email me about a pending assignment, I may send a hint to the whole class in answer to your question, *not* giving your name of course!

|            | **(Hand this problem in!)** Prove that the vector product (also called the cross product) of vectors in 3 dimensional space, does not satisfy an associative law for multiplication. (Hint: find a *simple* example of a cross product of 3 vectors that fails to be associative, showing the calculations. It is easiest to do this with the standard unit vectors: **i**, **j**, and **k**. You should know all the cross products among the three standard unit vectors!) Do problems 1.1, 1.4--1.6, 1.8, 1.10, 1.11. These are not to hand in, but **you should write your solutions on paper in order to learn from the work.** |
|            | Hand in: **1.3, 1.7.** Please remember to write neatly so the grader can read your work, and put your name on your paper so he can record the grades!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|            | Hand in: **1. Use the result of homework problem 1.3 to prove that the real number 1 is positive. That is, prove that 1>0.** (Hint: Use the Axiom of Trichotomy to see that there are only 3 potential cases for the number 1. Show that two of those cases lead to an impossibility, leaving only one possibility.) Do problem **1.9.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
