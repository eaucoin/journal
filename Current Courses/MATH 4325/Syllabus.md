## Course Description

The course will introduce Fourier analysis along with several relevant applications including from mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and computation. The focus of this course will be in one dimension, though most of the techniques generalize to multiple dimensions.

The course will cover the Fourier series for analyzing periodic functions, the Discrete Fourier Transform on the finite vector spaces, and the Fourier transform over the whole real line.

The course will also introduce a light introduction to operator theory in the context of Fourier Analysis, including Floquet-Bloch theory with applications in periodic media such as electronic structure of crystals and meta-materials.


## Assignments & Tests:

Homework assignments will be assigned weekly and due on Tuesdays in class. Please turn in hard copies. There will be a homework assignment once a week each with equal weight.

There will be two in-person midterm exams during class.


## Prerequisites:

Math 1552 or 1553, and one of the following: Math 2057, 2058, 2065, 2070, 2085, 2090.

## Grading Scale

(Grading may be curved to improve letter grade, but curving will never lower your letter grade relative to the straight scale below).

| Grade | Range    | Grade | Range    | Grade | Range    |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| A+    | 97.5+    | B-    | 79.5-82.4 | D     | 62.5-66.4 |
| A     | 93.5-97.4 | C+    | 76.5-79.4 | D-    | 59.5-62.4 |
| A-    | 89.5-93.4 | C     | 72.5-76.4 | F     | 0-59.4   |
| B+    | 86.5-89.4 | C-    | 69.5-72.4 |       |          |
| B     | 82.5-86.4 | D+    | 66.5-69.4 |       |          |



## Calculators and Collaboration:

You can use any technology available to help with homework, and you may collaborate with others while doing them. However, on exams you may only use a scientific calculator that does not do graphs or symbolic manipulation, such as solving equations and symbolically calculating derivatives and integrals. Work on in-class exams must be your own work with no assistance from anyone else. During an exam, attempts to look at other students' work, the use of cheat sheets or formula sheets, and any attempts to access the internet will be considered to be a violation of the LSU Code of Student Conduct.


## LSU student code of conduct

The LSU student code of conduct explains student rights, excused absences, and what is expected of student behavior. Students are expected to understand this code as described here: [http://www.lsu.edu/students/saa/students/codeofconduct.php](http://www.lsu.edu/students/saa/students/codeofconduct.php). Any violations of the LSU student code will be duly reported to the Dean of Students.



## Disabilities

Louisiana State University is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities. The syllabus is available in alternate formats upon request.

If you have a disability that may have some impact on your work in this class and for which you may require accommodations, please see a staff member in Disabilities Services so that such accommodations can be considered. Students that receive accommodation letters, please meet with me to discuss the provisions of those accommodations as soon as possible.



## Academic Success

The primary ingredients of your academic success are attending class, managing your time efficiently, taking good notes, and developing good critical thinking and communication abilities. LSU has a number of excellent resources that will assist you in developing these skills. The place to begin is the Center for Academic Success ([http://www.lsu.edu/students/cas/](http://www.lsu.edu/students/cas/)). The CAS offers guidance on what learning strategies are best suited to your talents, tutoring in the basic subjects, and workshops on a variety of topics, from note taking to time management. Communication Across the Curriculum ([http://cxc.lsu.edu](http://cxc.lsu.edu)) assists students in developing the communication skills necessary for academic and professional success. Finally, with respect to professional success, the LSU Online Career Center ([http://www.lsu.edu/students/careercenter/](http://www.lsu.edu/students/careercenter/)) can assist you in choosing a major, a profession that best suits your talents and passions, and help you develop a four year career plan to ensure success when you graduate from LSU.

LSU Cares is dedicated to your wellbeing and to promoting a community that cares about each of its members. At [https://www.lsu.edu/student-affairs/lsu-cares.php](https://www.lsu.edu/student-affairs/lsu-cares.php) you can see LSU Cares' resources for supporting your health and well-being.
