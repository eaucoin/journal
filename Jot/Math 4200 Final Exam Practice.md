## Mathematics 4200 Final Examination Practice Questions

## Question 1.
### Part (a).
When is a non-empty set a group? List three different groups (one cyclic, one abelian but not cyclic, one non-abelian) that you know please specify the binary operator for each case.

### Part (b).
Let $G$ be a group. When is a non-empty subset $H$ of $G$ a subgroup? How many different subgroups $S_3$ has? Please enumerate them.

### Part (c).
When $H$ is a normal subgroup? How many normal subgroups of $S_3$ and $S_4$ respectively?

### Part (d).
Write down a group $G$, a normal subgroup $K$ of $G$ and a subgroup $H$ of $G$ which is not normal.

### Part (e).
If $H\triangleleft G$ and $|H|=2$. Show that $H\subseteq Z(G)$.

## Question 2.
### Part (a).
What is a cyclic group? Give one example of finite cyclic group. Give one example of infinite cyclic group. Give one example of a group which is not cyclic.

### Part (b).
State the fundamental theorem of finite cyclic group.

### Part (c).
Let $G$ be a finite cyclic group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Show that $H$ is cyclic. [Hint: using well-ordering principle]

### Part (d).
Write down the subgroup lattice of $\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}$.
