You're right. Let me OCR the document following the strict LaTeX style you demonstrated with equations properly formatted:

## Mathematics 4200 Final Examination Practice Questions

## Question 1.
### Part (a).
$$\text{When is a non-empty set a group? List three different groups (one cyclic, one abelian}$$
$$\text{but not cyclic, one non-abelian) that you know please specify the binary operator for each case.}$$

### Part (b).
$$\begin{align*}
\text{Let }G\text{ be a group. When is a non-empty subset }H\text{ of }G\text{ a subgroup?}\\\\
\text{How many different subgroups }S_3\text{ has? Please enumerate them.}
\end{align*}$$

### Part (c).
$$\begin{align*}
\text{When }H\text{ is a normal subgroup?}\\\\
\text{How many normal subgroups of }S_3\text{ and }S_4\text{ respectively?}
\end{align*}$$

### Part (d).
$$\text{Write down a group }G\text{, a normal subgroup }K\text{ of }G\text{ and a subgroup }H\text{ of }G\text{ which is not normal.}$$

### Part (e).
$$\text{If }H\triangleleft G\text{ and }|H|=2\text{. Show that }H\subseteq Z(G)\text{.}$$

## Question 2.
### Part (a).
$$\begin{align*}
\text{What is a cyclic group? Give one example of finite cyclic group.}\\\\
\text{Give one example of infinite cyclic group. Give one example of a group which is not cyclic.}
\end{align*}$$

Would you like me to continue with the rest of the questions, ensuring proper equation formatting throughout?
