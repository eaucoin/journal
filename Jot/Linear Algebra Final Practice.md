# Math 4153 Review Problems

1. Suppose that $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of a vector space $V$. Prove that $U \cap W$ is a subspace of $V$.

2. Suppose that $v_1, v_2, v_3$ spans $V$. Prove that $v_1, v_1 + v_2, v_1 + v_2 + v_3$ also spans $V$.

3. Suppose that $v_1, v_2, v_3$ are linearly independent. Prove that $v_1, v_1 + v_2, v_1 + v_2 + v_3$ are also linearly independent.

4. Suppose that $T$ is a linear map from $V$ to $V$. Let $v_1,v_2,\ldots v_m$ be vectors in $V$. Suppose that $Tv_1, Tv_2,\ldots Tv_m$ are linearly independent. Prove that $v_1,v_2,\ldots v_m$ are linearly independent.

5. Prove that there does not exist a linear map from $\mathbb{R}^4$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$ with null space
$$U = \{(t,2t,3t,4t) \in \mathbb{R}^4 : t \in \mathbb{R}\}.$$

6. Let $D$ be the differential operator: $Dp(z) = p'(z)$, defined as a linear map from $\mathcal{P}_3(\mathbb{R})$ to $\mathcal{P}_3(\mathbb{R})$. Find a basis for $\mathcal{P}_3(\mathbb{R})$. Write down the matrix of $D$ under this basis.

7. Given $T \in \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R}^4)$,
$$T(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) = (0,x_2,2x_3,3x_4).$$
List all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $T$.
