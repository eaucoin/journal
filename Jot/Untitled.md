Let $p$ be an odd prime and $g$ a primitive root of $p$. Show using the definition that $g^{-1} \pmod{p}$ is also a primitive root.

$$\mathbb{Z}_p^{*}=\{1,g^1,g^2,\dots g^{p-1}\}$$
Then what sends $g$ to $1$ is obviously $g^{p-1}$, since $gg^{p-1}=g^{p}=1$. Now, is $g^{p-1}$ a primitive root? For $0\leq n\leq p-1$,
$$\begin{align*}

(g^{p-1})^{n}&=(g^{p})^{n}(g^n)^{-1}\\
&=

\end{align*}$$
