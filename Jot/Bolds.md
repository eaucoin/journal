Ah sorry. Here's the direct rewrite of just that section:

**(2) To exclude $p=2$ case:**
Let's prove 2 cannot be represented as $x^2-2y^2$:
Suppose $2 = x^2-2y^2$. Then:
$x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{2} \implies x$ is even $\implies x = 2k$

Substituting:
$2 = 4k^2-2y^2$
$1 = 2k^2-y^2$
$y^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \implies y$ is odd

Since $y$ is odd, $y = 2j+1$ for some $j$. Substituting:
$1 = 2k^2-(2j+1)^2$
$1 = 2k^2-4j^2-4j-1$
$2 = 2k^2-4j^2-4j$
$k^2 = 2j^2+2j+1$

But the right hand side is odd, while the left hand side is a perfect square, a contradiction.
