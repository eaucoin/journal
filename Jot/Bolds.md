Let me rewrite those bold statements as specific mathematical problems showing their contribution to Euler's Theorem:

**(1) To justify the coprime condition:** Show that when $\gcd(a,b)\neq 1$, the theorem can fail by finding specific integers $a,b$ where some divisor of $a^2+b^2$ cannot be written as $c^2+d^2$ with $\gcd(c,d)=1$.

**(2) To begin factorization:** Show that any divisor $e>1$ of $a^2+b^2$ can be written as $e = u\pi_1\pi_2...\pi_n$ where $u$ is a unit in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ and each $\pi_k$ is a Gaussian prime, by using the factorization $a^2+b^2=(a+bi)(a-bi)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.

**(3) To establish key division property:** Prove that for any Gaussian prime $\pi$ dividing $e$, either $\pi \mid (a+bi)$ or $\pi \mid (a-bi)$ but not both (as this would contradict $\gcd(a,b)=1$).

**(4) To restrict prime factors:** Prove that no Gaussian prime $\pi=q+ir$ dividing $e$ can be an ordinary prime $p$ in $\mathbb{Z}$, as this would force $p \mid \gcd(a,b)=1$.

**(5) To pair prime factors:** Show that if $\pi=q+ir$ divides $e$, then its conjugate $\overline{\pi}=q-ir$ also divides $e$, and prove these factors must be distinct when $\gcd(a,b)=1$.

**(6) To obtain desired form:** Use the conjugate pairing of prime factors to prove $e=(c+di)(c-di)=c^2+d^2$ for some $c,d \in \mathbb{Z}$.

**(7) To complete the theorem:** Prove that the integers $c,d$ in the representation $e=c^2+d^2$ must satisfy $\gcd(c,d)=1$ by showing any common factor would force a contradiction with $\gcd(a,b)=1$.
