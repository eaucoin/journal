Here are the revised bold statements as specific mathematical problems:

**(1) To analyze the key auxiliary polynomial:** For the polynomial $g(y) = \frac{1}{a_0}f(p_1p_2...p_ky)$, prove it has the same degree $m$ as $f(x)$ by showing its leading coefficient $\frac{a_m}{a_0}(p_1p_2...p_k)^m$ is nonzero.

**(2) To establish well-definedness:** Prove that $g(y)$ has integer coefficients by showing that each coefficient $\frac{a_j}{a_0}(p_1p_2...p_k)^j$ is an integer.

**(3) To connect prime factors:** Prove that if a prime $p$ divides $g(y)$ for some $y \in \mathbb{Z}$, then $p$ must divide $f(x)$ for some $x \in \mathbb{Z}$, by explicitly constructing such an $x$.

**(4) To exclude original primes:** Show that none of the original primes $p_1,...,p_k$ can divide any value of $g(y)$ by proving $g(y) \equiv 1 \pmod{p_i}$ for all $y$ and all $i$.

**(5) To restrict possible values:** Use results from (3) and (4) to prove that $g(y)$ can only take values $\pm 1$ for all $y \in \mathbb{Z}$.

**(6) To bound solutions:** Show that the equations $g(y)=1$ and $g(y)=-1$ have at most $2m$ integer solutions combined, using the fact that $g$ has degree $m$.

**(7) To reach contradiction:** Show that the statements "$g(y)=\pm 1$ for all $y \in \mathbb{Z}$" and "$g(y)=\pm 1$ has at most $2m$ solutions" are mutually contradictory.

**(8) To complete the proof:** Conclude that the original assumption must be false, proving there are infinitely many primes dividing values of $f(x)$.
