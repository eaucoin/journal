Let me analyze why this solution doesn't make sense:

1. First issue: The line "$x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{2}$" is meaningless because all squares are 0 mod 2, and 2 â‰¡ 0 mod 2. So while the conclusion "x is even" might be true, this isn't how we should prove it.

2. The proof starts assuming $y = 2j$ after showing $y$ must be odd. This is contradictory - if $y$ is odd, it can't be $2j$.

Let me try to write a clearer proof:

If $2 = x^2-2y^2$, working modulo 2:
- $2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$
- So $x^2 \equiv 2y^2 \pmod{2}$
- But $x^2 \equiv 0,1 \pmod{2}$ and $2y^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$
- So $x^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$
- Therefore $x$ must be even, say $x = 2k$

Substituting $x = 2k$ into original equation:
- $2 = 4k^2-2y^2$
- $1 = 2k^2-y^2$
- $y^2 = 2k^2-1$

But this is impossible because:
- The RHS is even minus 1 = odd
- The LHS is a square, which must be $0$ or $1$ mod 2

Therefore, 2 cannot be represented as $x^2-2y^2$.

Does this proof make more sense?




Let me break this down step by step:

1. We start with $2 = x^2-2y^2$
   
2. In modulo 2 arithmetic, $2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$
   So our equation becomes:
   $0 \equiv x^2-2y^2 \pmod{2}$
   
3. Rearranging:
   $x^2 \equiv 2y^2 \pmod{2}$

4. Now, for ANY number $y$:
   - $2y^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$ (because anything multiplied by 2 is 0 mod 2)

5. So our equation is:
   $x^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$

6. For any integer $x$:
   - If $x$ is even: $x^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$
   - If $x$ is odd: $x^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$

7. Since we found $x^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$, $x$ must be even

Would you like me to justify any of these steps further? In particular, would it help to see why $2y^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$ for any $y$?



Let me walk through what happens after we know $x$ is even (so $x=2k$):

Starting with $2 = x^2-2y^2$
1. Substitute $x=2k$:
   $2 = (2k)^2-2y^2$
   $2 = 4k^2-2y^2$

2. Subtract $2y^2$ from both sides:
   $2-2y^2 = 4k^2-2y^2-2y^2$
   $2-2y^2 = 4k^2-4y^2$

3. Add $4y^2$ to both sides:
   $2-2y^2+4y^2 = 4k^2$
   $2+2y^2 = 4k^2$

4. Divide everything by 2:
   $1+y^2 = 2k^2$

5. Subtract $y^2$ from both sides:
   $1 = 2k^2-y^2$

At this stage, we have:
- RHS is $2k^2-y^2$
- LHS is 1

This means $y^2 = 2k^2-1$, which we can use to reach a contradiction.

Would you like me to explain why this leads to a contradiction?


You mean these lines:
> - The RHS is even minus 1 = odd
> - The LHS is a square, which must be 0 or 1 mod 2

Let me try to explain more clearly:

The equation $y^2 = 2k^2-1$ gives us a contradiction because:
- The RHS, $2k^2-1$, is always odd (because $2k^2$ is always even, and even minus 1 is odd)
- But the LHS, $y^2$, is always 0 or 1 modulo 2 (since any square is congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 2)
- An odd number can't equal a square

Actually, maybe that third point needs justification too. Would you like me to explain why an odd number (greater than 1) can't be a perfect square?
