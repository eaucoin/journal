**(1) To restrict possible prime values:** Prove that if a prime $p$ is of the form $x^2-2y^2$, then $p \equiv \pm1 \pmod{8}$ by:
1. Analyzing all possible values of $x^2 \pmod{8}$
2. Analyzing all possible values of $2y^2 \pmod{8}$
3. Showing that for primes $p \equiv 3,5 \pmod{8}$, $p$ must be prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$

**(2) To exclude $p=2$ case:** Prove that 2 cannot be represented as $x^2-2y^2$ by showing any such representation leads to a contradiction modulo 2.

**(3) To begin reverse implication:** For primes $p \equiv \pm1 \pmod{8}$, prove that 2 is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ using quadratic reciprocity, yielding an integer $m$ where $m^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{p}$.

**(4) To show factorization in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$:** Use the quadratic residue from (3) to prove that $p$ cannot be prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ by showing it would lead to $p=2$, contradicting $p \equiv \pm1 \pmod{8}$.

**(5) To establish division algorithm:** Prove that $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ has the division property by explicitly constructing remainders with norm less than the divisor's norm.

**(6) To complete representation:** Use the non-primality from (4) to factor $p$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ and prove this factorization yields a representation $p=x^2-2y^2$, completing the proof that $p \equiv \pm1 \pmod{8}$ implies $p=x^2-2y^2$.
