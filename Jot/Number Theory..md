## Homework for the Week of November 11th.

### Problem 1. The goal of this exercise is to show how $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ sheds light on sum of two squares in other ways than what we've done so far.

Namely, we show the following theorem of Euler: If $a,b$ are integers with $\gcd(a,b)=1$, then any divisor of $a^2+b^2$ is of the form $c^2+d^2$ with $\gcd(c,d)=1$.

**(1)** Give an example that shows why the condition $\gcd(a,b)=1$ is necessary.

If $\gcd(a,b) \neq 1$, the theorem doesn't hold. For example, let $a = 2$ and $b = 4$. Then $\gcd(a, b) = 2$. We have $a^2 + b^2 = 20$, and $4$ is a divisor of $20$. However, $4$ can only be expressed as $c^2 + d^2$ if $c=2, d=0$ or $c=0, d=2$. If we require $\gcd(c, d) = 1$, then $4$ is not expressible in the required form.

**(2)** Let $e>1$ be an integer divisor of $a^2+b^2$. Show that $e$ is a product of Gaussian prime divisors $q+ir$ up to units.
